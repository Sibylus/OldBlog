    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Many landlords and property managers struggle to find ways to keep pace with the growing overhead costs of their rental properties such as increased utility bills, rising insurance premiums and the never-ending demands for maintenance. Here are 4 ways you can increase the revenue from your rental property:</p>

<h3>Complete Simple Renovations</h3>

<p>Tenants like rental units that look updated. By completing simple, low-cost renovations and improvements like painting the walls, updating the light fixtures and replacing the toilet, faucets and electrical switch plates you can breathe new life into a dated rental unit and help attract and retain tenants, reducing your turnover costs. However, try to stay away from low quality updates to your property. Tenants will notice this lack of quality as they continue to inhabit your unit, and they will be less likely to renew.</p>

<h3>Perform Major Upgrades</h3>

<p>If you want to attract premium tenants to your properties, you need to provide them with premium features. Include things like an in-suite washer/dryer, a dishwasher, off-street parking, storage and/or a security system. Consider investing in some capital improvements to your property to make your unit look and feel like a luxury rental. In return, you can charge premium rent for your snazzy, upgraded unit.</p>

<h3>Raise The Rent</h3>

<p>It sounds easy, but you should verify your units' rents are priced reasonably according to the local market and neighborhood.
In most jurisdictions, regular rent increases are permitted. If you aren't bothering to increase your rent in line with regulations, you're leaving money on the table as inflation of maintenance services, regular upkeep and overhead expenses eat away from your bottom line.
Perhaps more importantly, pay attention to similar units in your market.
If your rent is noticeably lower, you probably will want to raise it.
While rent increases tend to be unpopular with tenants, most expect their property owners to charge current market value for their properties.</p>

<h3>Improve Customer Service</h3>

<p>Happy tenants are stable tenants. Think of your tenants as your customers, like any customer-service based business, the better you are at providing great customer service, the more successful your business will be. By responding quickly to <a href="http://www.rentobo.com/blog/responding-quickly-to-maintenance-requests/">maintenance requests</a>, being courteous and presenting yourself in a professional manner (even when you get the dreaded 3 a.m. phone call) your tenants will respond by treating you with respect. They will be more likely to pay their rent on time, take care of their unit and stay put, all things that help to boost your bottom line.</p>

<p>While increasing your rental income can seem like a daunting task, with a little effort and fine-tuning, you can raise the revenues of your rental or property management business.</p>
