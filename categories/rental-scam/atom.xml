    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Even the best landlord can fall victim to a scam. However, you can avoid being a victim of one if you know what to look for. Here are some simple rules you can follow to sniff out a fraud before they can do damage to your business.</p>

<h3>Meet with the prospective tenant whenever possible</h3>

<p>Meeting in person can protect both the landlord and the potential tenant during the leasing process. A genuine prospect shouldn’t have any trouble agreeing to meet. Sometimes you will have an out-of-state or even an international prospect (<a href="http://www.rentobo.com/blog/three-tips-for-brokering-a-relocating-tenant">see our article on leasing to out-of-state or relocating tenants</a>). This is OK, but make sure you communicate directly with the renter and recognize when they are trying to withhold certain details about their identity. Any refusal to provide you with reasonable information (employment info, ssn on the application, past rental history, etc.) is suspicious and you should probably move on.</p>

<h3>Do not accept cashier's checks or wire transfers</h3>

<p>Some scammers might try to avoid meeting with you in person and will dodge the verification process. One way for them to do this is to <em>advance</em> a deposit in the form of cashier’s checks or wire transfers, which are hard to trace. A person with a bad rental history may try to con their way into your unit by paying you money upfront, under a different name. Avoid this by refusing payment via these methods and opt for a check instead.</p>

<h3>Check periodically for copycat listings</h3>

<p>What some scammers will do is pose as the landlord of your property, even if its not currently available, and offer the same unit at a too good to be true price. They will then collect deposit money from prospective tenants and disappear overnight. The tenant is left with no money and no apartment. Others will go so far as to collect rent from a <a href="http://www.independentmail.com/news/2013/feb/15/deputies-fake-landlord-rented-homes-he-didnt-own/">property they didn't own</a>. To avoid this, simply check for listings with your address or zip code on Google or rental search sites such as craigslist. If you don’t see your name or an authorized contact as the listed agent, report the listing immediately.</p>
