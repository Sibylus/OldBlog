    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Selling your home is an important decision that should be evaluated carefully in the context of your personal and familial financial situation and needs.  While there are many factors as to why someone would sell, the current robust rental climate can spell opportunity for the right potential landlord. Here are some reasons why renting your home---even temporarily---could be the right move.</p>

<h3>Cover costs while the housing market rebounds</h3>

<p>If you need to sell your home but you aren’t getting the price you want, you might want to wait a year or two. Having a quality tenant in the meantime can help you bridge the gap. To do this, first calculate the costs of keeping and maintaining your home while it is vacant. There can be some additional costs associated with being a landlord (taxes, general maintenance repairs, etc.) so be sure to include those expenses as well. Next, get a sense of what the going rate is for similar rentals in your area---you might be surprised by the results. If the difference in costs are justifiable, go for it!</p>

<h3>You can take advantage of both markets</h3>

<p>According to a <a href="http://http://trends.truliablog.com/vis/rentvsbuy-spr2012/">2012 report based on Trulia’s Buy vs. Rent index</a>, it is cheaper to buy than rent in 98 of the 100 largest metro areas in the country. Chances are that you live in an area where you can take advantage of this. Here’s how: maximize the monthly cash flow coming into your household by securing a tenant at a monthly rate that would surpass your current mortgage. Whether you are downsizing, upgrading or making a parallel switch to a different area, your monthly mortgage cost will likely be less than the monthly rent amount for a similar property. In other words, <em>you are getting the best for your money at both ends of the spectrum</em>.</p>

<h3>You can avoid foreclosure</h3>

<p>The sad truth is that a good amount of families will list their home in order to avoid foreclosure. What’s worse is that a portion of these same families are underwater in their mortgages. However, for some of these people, and maybe you, having a tenant might save you from foreclosure. While it can be difficult to downsize by <em>buying</em> another house (especially with an underwater mortgage,) you can scout for a lease of your own and slash your monthly housing payment. Meanwhile, you can lease your home to a tenant that can pay a premium that will cover most, if not all, your mortgage payment. This is a savvy method of keeping a house that you may not currently be able to afford, and many real estate brokers will recommend this exact move.</p>

<p>As always, there are many factors to consider before becoming a landlord. Before making any decision like this, it is important to fully understand the implications (taxes, lifestyle, and time) of each option.
