    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Property owners in college towns face unique challenges with their rental properties. Owning an attractive, well-priced investment suite in a high-demand area near a school can result in healthy profits. However, renting to students often means dealing with seasonal leases, subletting and co-tenancy between roommates.</p>

<h3>Students Expect Digital Marketing</h3>

<p>The days of posting handwritten signs on student bulletin boards are gone; today's students are tech-savvy and focused on digital content. To market your off-campus housing to student tenants, you need to <a href="http://www.rentobo.com">advertise your rentals online</a>. There are many free or low-cost listing options for local landlords and with a service that syndicates your listing, you can post to them <a href="http://www.rentobo.com/benefits#exposure">simultaneously</a>.</p>

<p>In addition to promoting to national rental sites, consider advertising online to local online classifieds, such as the major college's student newspaper. Other tech-friendly features that can help make you a preferred landlord are the option of online rent payments, <a href="http://www.rentobo.com/benefits#applications">online rental applications</a> and the availability of high-speed Internet on the rental property. Many colleges and universities often have their own portals for students searching for off-campus housing, so you should advertise on those as well.</p>

<h3>Catering To Student Tenants</h3>

<p>Student tenants often want to either lease a property for the school year (usually September to April) or have the option to sublet the unit during times when they are away from school. Property owners who target student renters need to create student-friendly leases that accommodate their schedule. With the right lease, many students remain with the same landlord for the duration of their degree and postgraduate programs. Include student-friendly clauses like allowing roommates, subletting and discounts for times when the unit that appeal to student tenants.</p>

<p>With the right tools and knowledge, property owners can successfully attract and retain responsible, stable student tenants to their off-campus housing. Post-secondary students are attracted to rentals with student-friendly rental terms that are close to campus, convenient to transit, shopping and other services. Advertise your off-campus housing where students will see it - on multiple rental housing sites, local online classifieds and through housing portals on college websites.</p>

    <updated>2012-10-11T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.rentobo.com/blog/5-critical-steps-to-make-your-rental-listing</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As the rental market thrives in the long aftermath of the housing crisis, it can
be tough to shine in a competitive environment. Most of the time, just sticking
to some solid general principles can make the real difference in your listings,
and get the prospective tenants you want to respond to it.</p>

<p>Keeping that in mind, we have put together 5 critical steps you can implement
quickly to maximize the success of your search for tenants.</p>

<h3>A Picture is Worth A Thousand Words</h3>

<p>When it comes to photographs, you need to focus on 2 things---clarity and
volume. People are visual. Your photographs can say things about an apartment
that descriptive details simply cannot. Generally, the first thing people do
when they view your listing is notice the photographs. Be sure to provide
photographs that will enable your prospects to make informed decisions when
considering your unit for the new home. </p>

<p>The benefit to this is efficiency. If prospective tenants have a clearer vision
of your property, it is likely they will be more serious about choosing it.
Therefore, you are saving time for yourself and your prospective tenants by
showing the unit to someone that is truly interested in living there.</p>

<h3>Every Property Is Unique</h3>

<p><img class="right" src="http://oblog.rentobo.com/images/45060625-stand-out-from-the-crowd1.jpg"></p>

<p>Alongside photographs, fully describing your unit in the listing assists the
prospective tenant in making their decision to view the property. This seems
like a very simple concept, but what we've found is that many listings stick to
the same limited format such as beds/baths, whether it's been renovated and not
much else. </p>

<p>Of course, listing core features is important, but this doesn't make your
listing all that unique. To stand out, a mere mention of one or two additional
character traits about your property can make a prospective tenant more excited.
Claw-foot tubs? Don't leave it out. Old kitchen, newer appliances? Check.
Interesting layout? You get the point.</p>

<p>Remember, an excited prospect will turn in their paperwork more quickly, which
will enable you to rent your unit faster. Listing a few extra details that
distinguish your property will give it a personality that puts your listing
above others. Your prospective tenants will be more likely to want your unique
unit and want to call it home.</p>

<h3>Every Neighborhood Has Character</h3>

<p>The neighborhood in which a property is located can be as critical as the
property itself.  Many prospective tenants have an idea of the neighborhood/s in
which they want to live, but just as many don't. For these people, you have a
real opportunity to tell a story about what to expect if they want to live at
your unit.</p>

<p>Of course, if there are parks, cafes and restaurants nearby these are always
good to mention. But what else? Ask yourself what is interesting within a
half-mile radius of the property. This will assist prospective tenants in
choosing your unit as it will give them information they may not have, and they
will appreciate it. This is a particularly good piece of information for someone
looking to relocate from out of state or abroad. Some examples could include a
historic landmark or museum attraction...or better yet if the nearby park has a
playground or dog area---have fun being creative.</p>

<h3>Connect With Your Market</h3>

<p>Aside from budget considerations, certain properties tend to attract people that
other properties may not. Many people are looking for a connection to the place
they will potentially call home. So use your words to connect with them. For
instance, if students tend to gravitate to a listing you have, you may say,
'great for students.' Other examples you may see on listings include words like
'eclectic' or 'elegant.' </p>

<p>Of course, be sure to follow fair housing laws and always avoid any preference
or discrimination (which is also morally and ethically wrong.) A couple 'tag
words' or 'labels' will do the trick, and the people that respond to your
listing will generally be more excited about it.</p>

<h3>Maximize Your Exposure</h3>

<p>When marketing their listings, most brokers understand that few of the above
mentioned tips will work if your unit is not given maximum exposure. You need to
maximize your property's exposure to prospective tenants. While there are a host
of different rental search sites where you can post your listing, posting on ONE
of them can be insufficient, and posting on MANY of them individually can be
time-consuming.</p>

<p>Fortunately, <a href="http://www.rentobo.com" title="Rentobo | Rental Property Software">Rentobo</a> can help you with this dilemma. Our site has a free
feature called listing syndication. When a property owner or broker lists their
property with Rentobo, they can avoid the hassle of individually posting on
multiple sites one by one, and post simultaneously. Many of our users are
already doing this. Besides the obvious time-saving difference, the overwhelming
consensus is that having more exposure leads to more serious and better
qualified leads. </p>

<p>One thing that is certain about our world, people are always going to need a
place to live in and call home. With a rental market that is truly broad,
competition is always going to be a factor. So do a little work on the front-end
of the process to make the rest of it run more smoothly. Whether you are
searching for your next 1 or 100 tenants, follow these steps and enjoy the
rewards.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.rentobo.com" title="Rentobo | Rental Property Software">Rentobo</a> is committed to being the easiest and most efficient online tool you
will ever use in your search for new tenants. We are constantly adding new
features and looking to improve upon what we offer, so if you'd like to learn

    <link href="http://www.rentobo.com/blog/announcing-new-rentobocom-site-enhancements-w/"/>
    <updated>2012-06-04T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.rentobo.com/blog/announcing-new-rentobocom-site-enhancements-w</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The Team at Rentobo would like to thank everyone in advance for a tremendous
amount of awesome and helpful feedback! We have been working very hard to
improve our site, and make it more valuable for our users. The Team has been
listening to your needs, wants and desires, and have responded with these
updates. More to come!</p>

<h2>Larger Photos</h2>

<p>In response to user feedback we have increased the size of the photos on the
Rentobo listing page. We have also improved our strategy for processing and
resizing uploaded photos to ensure they are displayed as consistently as
possible on partner sites. </p>

<h3>Photo Uploads Made Simple</h3>

<p>Our users can now upload photos using a simple drag and drop feature.  This
means you can literally drag your chosen photos from your desktop folder into
our upload box, and the photos will automatically upload.  You can load one at a
time, or highlight and drag several photos at once!</p>

<p>We have also made it easier for users to rearrange uploaded photos for each
listing.  We have employed a dragging feature which allows you to drag the
photos you have already uploaded into their appropriate spots.  This allows you
to display your photos in any order, without restriction.</p>

<p><img src="http://oblog.rentobo.com/images/42095304-RentObo_Photo_Reorder.png"></p>

<h3>Print and Go Tenant Handouts</h3>

<p>Users can now easily download a tenant handout, print and distribute them at
showings and open houses in place of paper applications.  The handouts convert
to PDF format for easy printing. Tenant Handouts guide potential tenants back to
Rentobo to apply and help tenants to remember your listing after a day of
apartment hunting.</p>

<p><img src="http://oblog.rentobo.com/images/42095314-RentObo_Tenant_Handout.png"></p>

<h3>Introducing Apartable</h3>

<p>We are happy to introduce a new syndication partner for listing
promotion: <a href="http://www.apartable.com" title="Apartable.com">Apartable.com.</a> </p>

<p>Rentobo listings will be displayed on Apartable with a special badge to let
users know they can apply for the listing online with Rentobo.</p>

<h3>Other Improvements</h3>

<p>This release also includes a number of bugfixes and improvements to existing
functionality including but not limited to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Improved email notifications (with more information and links to review
relevant information)</li>
<li>Better reliability when posting to Craigslist by integrating listing
descriptions copied from MS Word</li>
<li>Added open house times to Craigslist posts (when applicable)</li>
<li>Simplified tenant signup when applying for a listing</li>
<li>Added additional scheduling options for open houses shorter than 30 minutes</li>
</ul>

efficient, user-friendly way to find and sign new tenants for your rental
property. If there are any questions or concerns you have while using our site,
