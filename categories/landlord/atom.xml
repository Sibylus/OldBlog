    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Marketing a rental listing is about getting exposure, which will draw prospects to your unit. When generating interest for your listing, a lot of property owners will settle for “good enough.” Unfortunately, if you settle for promoting your unit “just on craigslist,” for example, you really limit your audience. Here we present the case for syndicating your listings across multiple search sites.</p>

<h3>It's Faster</h3>

<p>Most property owners agree that displaying their listings in more than one place is beneficial. However, manually visiting each website individually to post their listings is hard to manage and time consuming. With multiple listings and properties, the problem is magnified greatly.</p>

<p>So if your time is precious, like all professionals and property owners, you’ve probably wished there was a better way. When you syndicate your listing using a syndication platform, such as <a href="http://www.rentobo.com">Rentobo</a>, you can actually submit your listing to multiple search sites at the same time. This will save you a lot of time and give you more time to work on other areas of your business.</p>

<h3>It’s Efficient</h3>

<p>In the real estate and rental markets, the term <a href="http://www.thefreedictionary.com/Syndication">syndication</a> has taken on a whole new meaning. When you choose to market your listing using a syndication platform such as Rentobo, you choose to let a multitude of real estate rental search sites, such as Zillow, Apartable, and Lovely, promote a common interest by displaying your listings. This is truly a powerful thing when you think about it.</p>

<p>Each one of these sites generate thousands of new eyes a day in most markets. Granted, some of those site visitors of Zillow may have come from craigslist. However, if a rental prospect has viewed your listing on multiple listing sites, they are more likely to click on it. Now, instead of posting on one site over and over again, you are able to provide multiple impressions through one piece of effort. That’s efficient.</p>

<h3>It’s Easy</h3>

<p>At Rentobo, we have made it incredibly easy to syndicate your listings. In just a few seconds, you can submit your listing to the most popular rental search sites on the web, simultaneously. This is how it works:</p>

<p>Once you have created a listing using Rentobo, you can manage your marketing efforts by selecting the<strong> Promote tab.</strong></p>

<p>Simply scroll to the bottom, and you will see a list of syndication partners to choose from. After that, just select the boxes corresponding to the sites you want to submit to, and click ‘Save Syndication Options.’
That’s it! Once your selections have been saved, Rentobo will create and submit listings to the partners you have selected, where they will appear within 24-48 hours.</p>

    <updated>2013-07-02T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.rentobo.com/blog/4-tips-for-new-landlords</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So you have taken the plunge, and become a new landlord! Maybe you decided to rent out a spare bedroom in your house, or you have acquired your first rental property. Being a landlord is no cakewalk, so hopefully you’ve done your research before taking the plunge. Just in case, here are some checklist items to make sure your business gets started on the right foot.</p>

<h3>Join A Landlord Association</h3>

<p>Many new landlords are in business for themselves---by themselves. If this is you, joining an association <a href="http://www.rentobo.com/blog/renting-property-join-a-landlord-association/">can have many benefits</a>. You can stay up to date on the local and national laws, news, and the best practices in your market. You can get invaluable insights from more veteran property owners. You can get the scoop on which vendors to use, and which ones to avoid. For example, there are a lot of different associations throughout Chicagoland and the state of Illinois, and a listing of these organizations can be found <a href="http://www.thelpa.com/lpa/associations/illinois.html">here</a>.</p>

<h3>Decide How Much You’re Willing To DIY</h3>

<p>Being a landlord can be a very hands on or automated business depending on how you manage it. Many property owners will go so far as handling maintenance requests by themselves! However, if you aren’t a professional handyman, you need to figure out how you’re going to quickly and efficiently handle repairs. We talk about the <a href="http://www.rentobo.com/blog/responding-quickly-to-maintenance-requests/">importance of handling requests well</a>, and with the right system in place, you will have happier renters and a more profitable business.</p>

<h3>Realize That You Might Get A Bad Renter</h3>

<p>Even the best property owners and managers will have a few renters that are less than ideal. The most common violation that you will face will be late or unpaid rent. Most renters have good intentions when they enter into a lease agreement, but financial situations change, and not everyone is <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2011/05/24/news/economy/americans_lack_emergency_funds/index.htm">prepared for them</a>. We would also recommend you come up with a set policy for noise disturbances and property costs beyond normal wear and tear on your unit.</p>

<h3>Use Rentobo To Find Your First Renters</h3>
