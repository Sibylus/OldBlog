    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Craigslist is one of the 10 highest ranking pages on the internet in the US, according to <a href="http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/craigslist.org">alexa.com</a>. Naturally, when building Rentobo, we decided to make it as convenient as possible to post your listing there. But craigslist is only the beginning. Market analysts have determined that 70% or more of new renters begin their searches <a href="http://www.mynewplace.com/press-releases/magnetic-marketing-apartment-owners-can-snare-the-lions-share-of-renters-by-ramping-up-their-online-initiatives">online</a>. With that in mind, we built our promotions tool to capture as much of that market, as efficiently as possible.</p>

<h3>How it works</h3>

<p>The days of needing to be computer savvy to market your property are over. With Rentobo, even a novice can now market online by <a href="http://www.rentobo.com/howitworks">using it to promote their listings</a>.</p>

<p>Using Rentobo, you can promote to craigslist and a host of other major rental search sites simultaneously and with just a few clicks. Unlike posting directly to craigslist, you can upload as many photos as youâ€™d like. Once you have created a listing, Rentobo will automatically save it into your management dashboard in case you need to use it at a later date.</p>

<h3>Accepting applications</h3>

<p>When you create and post a listing with Rentobo, prospective tenants can submit applications online. This way, you can receive information such as employment history, salary information and rental history before you ever speak with them on the phone or see them in person. A lot of landlords and brokers enjoy having this information before moving forward with a full credit and background screening.</p>

<p>*We are also in the process of integrating full background and credit screening with Rentobo. If you would like to learn more and participate in our upcoming, limited beta program for this feature, click <a href="http://www.rentobo.com/tenant_screening">here</a>.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The digital age has made various aspects of the property rental industry easier for businesses to maintain their day-to-day job. This includes the rental application. Online rental applications help streamline the application portion of the rental process and provide various benefits that paper versions cannot.</p>

<h3>Time Saver</h3>

<p>The amount of time you save by switching to online rental applications is the number one reason why property managers choose this option. Online applications allow the potential resident to quickly find out if they are eligible as a renter. After the credit and background checks come back, you can approve the resident and allow them to log in to the website and sign the apartment lease in a matter of minutes. Since electronic signatures are now considered as legally binding as written ones, the tenant can easily sign all required documents from the comfort of their home.</p>

<h3>Ease of Use</h3>

<p>Internet usage is more popular now than ever, and potential renters regularly search online for available rental properties. Online rental applications allow potential renters to fill out and send in the application as soon as they find your listing online. Offering the convenience of online rental applications puts you ahead of the competition and increases the amount of applications you receive. In addition, your listing will reach a greater number of tech-savvy, young tenants who know you are the type of landlord they can easily work with.</p>

<h3>Better Organization and Less Clutter</h3>

<p>Electronic applications drastically reduce the amount of paper flow you have to deal with. Rather than wading through a filing cabinet packed with individual leases, instantly pull the desired lease up on your computer. Also, you can easily make changes to your lease and make it available to residents immediately.</p>

<h3>Getting Started</h3>

<p>Getting started with online rental applications is a relatively simple process with various online resources designed to help property owners new to electronic applications. Typically, you can choose from a wide array of pre-made templates for the application or customize your very own. Another option is to upload the current application you are using and make it available electronically for potential renters.</p>

<p>Computers, the Internet and technology in general have greatly simplified and improved the way potential tenants find properties. By implementing electronic applications, you ensure your business won't miss out on all the benefits provided by online applications.</p>
