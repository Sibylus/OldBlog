    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The average homeowner buys and sells a home <a href="http://homebuying.about.com/od/sellingahouse/qt/0207WhyMove.htm">every 5-7 years</a>, so it is important to examine the costs over that period of time. Across the country, it is now less expensive to <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jed-kolko/renting-vs-buying_b_1881185.html">buy a home versus renting one</a> (which is great for landlords looking to profit on their investment). However, if a 20% down payment, inability to obtain financing, or other reasons make homeownership not in the cards, there are some markets where renting could be far more attractive.</p>

<h3>Methodology</h3>

<p>We took the most recent averages for a market (home sales price and rent price for a 2 bedroom residence) and compiled data based off of the following terms:</p>

<ul>
<li>2 bedroom residence</li>
<li>20% down payment</li>
<li>3.5% mortgage interest</li>
<li>Property tax for the listed market</li>
<li>6 years of tenancy</li>
<li>Other miscellaneous considerations, such as closing costs and maintenance costs (we used <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/business/buy-rent-calculator.html?_r=0">this tool</a> to help with our calculations).</li>
</ul>


<p>In addition to our input of raw data, we considered other more realistic factors, such as the typical “for sale” home being larger and more luxurious than the typical rental. With these factors in mind, we have put together three of the best cities you can live in if you are looking to rent instead of purchasing a home.</p>

<p><strong><em>For Landlords:</em></strong> <a href="http://www.rentobo.com/blog/single-family-rental-investment/">The case for single-family rental investment</a></p>

<h3>Manhattan, NY - (2 bedroom $850,000 sales price vs $3,650/mo rent)</h3>

<p><em>$3,673 savings/year for renters</em></p>

<p>Manhattan is a densely populated island, and is the most expensive of the five boroughs
of New York. In addition to the towering skyscrapers already present there, there is constant new construction. Even so, the vacancy rate is hovering <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-01-10/manhattan-rent-hikes-slow-as-apartment-tenants-push-back.html">around 1.5%</a> due to improving employment in a notoriously high demand area.</p>

<p>A modest 2 bedroom apartment in Manhattan will cost you around $850,000, which is much more comparable to the typical apartment for rent, but if you are looking for something more luxurious, expect your costs on either end to skyrocket (the actual average luxury 2 bedroom apartment was <a href="http://www.citi-habitats.com/media/pdf/Q2Report-2012.pdf">$1.25 million in 2012</a>).</p>

<h3>San Francisco, CA - (2 bedroom $725,000 sales price vs $2,900/mo rent)</h3>

<p><em>$2,081 savings/year for renters</em></p>

<p>The temperate San Francisco climate and high salaries due to the tech industry have driven a large number of workers to a tiny geographical area (less than 47 square miles for over 800,000 people),  so in the last decade San Francisco has become a very expensive place to live. A lot of people looking to live in San Francisco-proper have opted instead to live in nearby San Jose or Oakland, where prices are cheaper but rising.</p>

<p>San Francisco is a market with built-in demand and short supply, due to high population density but a shortage of skyscrapers. In fact, the only major US city with a higher population density in the entire US is New York.</p>

<h3>Honolulu, HI - (2 bedroom $465,000 sales price vs $1,725/mo rent)</h3>

<p><em>$446 savings/year for renters</em></p>

<p>Honolulu, HI is an island -- like Manhattan -- that is as much a destination for tourists as it is a hometown for locals. Many homes purchased here are used for secondary or vacation homes, and that secondary market has added to the demand.</p>

    <link href="http://www.rentobo.com/blog/single-family-rental-investment/"/>
    <updated>2013-04-04T00:00:00-07:00</updated>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last year, 367,000 single-family homes were sold in the US. This number is the highest since 2009, and nearly a 20% <a href="http://www.valueline.com/Markets/Commentary.aspx?id=14076">jump from 2011</a>. This is good news to participants in the housing market, but what are some of the economic drivers behind some of these purchases?</p>

<p>Investment firms such as <a href="http://www.blackstone.com/">Blackstone Group</a> and <a href="http://data.cnbc.com/quotes/SBY">Silver Bay Realty Trust</a> have allocated billions of dollars of capital towards the single-family market, with a focus on distressed and/or bank-owned foreclosure properties. The purpose of this investment is to buy in bulk, renovate if necessary, and rent out their inventory while the housing market rebounds. Jade Rahmani, an analyst with KBW, says “By some accounts, $6-9 billion has been raised or committed, suggesting potential acquisitions of 40,000-90,000 properties.” This accounts for roughly 15% of unsold REO (real estate owned) <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/100366417">housing units</a>.</p>

<p>Traditionally, a lot of real estate investment firms <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887324034804578346800317118568.html">had shied away from the single family market (paywall)</a> due to the complexities of managing geographically dispersed properties. We're developing Rentobo's next-generation <a href="http://www.rentobo.com">rental property management software platform</a> with this in mind; whether you're a single family landlord or a large organization with hundreds or thousands of units under management, we're building the best experience possible for finding and connecting with the best tenants for your property.</p>

<p>That is a big number that actually helps the rental market more than the housing market. Houses are being purchased, but the a large number of their owners are renting them out instead of actually living in them. Non-investment homeownership in the <a href="http://www.census.gov/housing/hvs/files/qtr412/q412press.pdf">US is down to 65%</a>, which is the lowest it has been in 15 years. Consider these factors:</p>

<ul>
<li>When people lose their homes to foreclosures, <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrapoza/2012/04/04/how-single-family-home-investing-can-save-the-housing-market/">60% end up renting a single-family home</a>, with another 23% renting an apartment.</li>
<li>Over the last five years, foreclosures have caused over <a href="http://www.realestateeconomywatch.com/2012/04/single-family-rentals-now-exceed-multifamily/">3 million homeowners</a> and put them into the rental market.</li>
<li>There are an estimated <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrapoza/2012/04/04/how-single-family-home-investing-can-save-the-housing-market/2/">6.3 million Generation Y</a> aspiring renters that currently live with their friends or at home while they financially establish themselves in a tough job market. These kids are expected to enter the rental market within the next 5 years.</li>
<li><a href="http://makinsensebabe.com/number-of-new-us-single-family-homes-sales-fell-in-december-2012-while-home-prices-rose-so-basically-nobody-can-afford-a-home/">22% of borrowers are are “underwater”</a> whereas a healthy economy would put that number at around 5%. For some of these people, without a lot of help, they will soon enter the rental market as well.</li>
<li>The U.S. has solid demographics for homeownership, but new housing supply is <a href="http://www.blackstone.com/news-views/blackstone-blog/blackstone-creates-national-single-family-rental-home-platform">63% below the historical average.</a></li>
</ul>


<p>Indicators such as these are perhaps the reason why <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/46538421/Warren_Buffett_on_CNBC_I_d_Buy_Up_A_Couple_Hundred_Thousand_Single_Family_Homes_If_I_Could">Warren Buffett</a> said “I’d buy up a couple thousand single-family homes” if he found it reasonable to do so. He believes that if you do buy a single-family home in which to live, make sure you get a 30 year mortgage (to keep your monthly cash expenses minimized) and refinance when rates are better.</p>

<p>For a family, a single-family unit is an attractive rental option. Families prefer to live in single-family units as opposed to large multi-family buildings. For property owners, these residents tend to be more stable and stay longer than a typical young single tenant.</p>

<p>What all of this means is that now is a better time than ever to consider renting out a single-family homes and becoming a landlord. Rates are low, the demand is not only high but inevitable, and in most markets, current mortgage payments are <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/monthly-rent-vs-monthly-mortgage-payment-2013-1">lower than rental premiums</a> (which means money in your pocket).</p>
