<p>When I went to look for my third apartment in the city, I started to learn that not
only is it important to look for a great apartment and location but that finding a
great <a href="http://www.williampaid.com/blog/index.php/2012/07/a-good-landlord-is-not-always-easy-to-find/">landlord</a> is equally as important. While “location, location, location” may be
the universal mantra of real estate agents and renters, my own personal mantra
during my apartment searches has been “landlord, landlord, landord!”
After having three different landlords in the span of three years, I can hopefully shed
some light on what landlords can do to better serve their renters.</p>

<h3>Know the laws of the city you are leasing in</h3>

<p>Each state and city has a landlord and tenant act that covers specific laws and
regulations regarding rent, security deposits, tenant rights, evictions, etc. My first
landlord printed a general Chicago <a href="http://www.williampaid.com/blog/index.php/2012/04/renting-an-apartment-top-10-questions-to-ask-a-landlord-before-signing-a-lease/">lease</a> and when my roommates and I asked
questions about late fees and certain laws that we might have to abide by, she
looked at us with a dumbstruck look of confusion. It was hard for us to take her
seriously when she didn’t even know the basic laws that she as a landlord was
expected to follow. Know the laws and be able to articulate them to your renters.</p>

<h3>Customize the lease</h3>

<p>Having a custom lease with personal instructions you want your renters to follow
is always helpful. My one landlord did this and he had a ‘move-out rider” attached
to the lease that detailed exactly what he wanted us to do when we moved out,
complete with a checklist. This was a great way for us to know exactly what was
expected of us so that our security deposit could be returned in full.</p>

<h3>Listen to our concerns</h3>

<p>One time both the front and back doors of my apartment building were broken and
I promptly called my landlord to let him know that I wanted it fixed. I called on a
Friday and no one came to fix either door until Monday morning. When it comes to
matters of safety, a landlord should respond in a timely manner. This is especially
important if the problem makes the apartment and your renters susceptible to
harm and theft. If it’s something as little as a broken dishwasher or as serious as
a broken front door, make sure you listen to your renter’s concerns and respond
appropriately. And for the safety of us renters, quickly!</p>

<h3>Be attentive (but respect our privacy!)</h3>

<p>Be there when you‘re needed but don’t hover. The landlord in my first apartment
kept some of her old things in our apartment and proceeded to let herself in to grab
things whenever she needed. This is not only illegal but also definitely a violation
of a renter’s privacy. Don’t barge in whenever you please. While we may be renting,
this is our apartment for the duration of the lease. Plus, we could be just getting out
of the shower!</p>

<h3>Offer Online Rent Payments</h3>

<p>Every landlord I’ve had has been very specific about how they want to receive rent.
The easiest way for renters is to pay rent online. For landlords, this will ensure that
rent is received on time each month. It is simple and convenient for renters and
after all, doesn’t a happy renter make a happy landlord?</p>
