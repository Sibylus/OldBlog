    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Landlords who want to attract the best tenants and achieve low turnover rates know the importance of regular property maintenance, however, most property owners have difficulty deciding if they should invest in a major renovation on their personal rental property. When renting property, it can be tempting to simply leave your rental units alone, but doing the right renovations can maintain the value of your investment. You can also attract higher rent payments from stable tenants who are willing to pay a premium for a modern, updated rental apartment or home.</p>

<h3>When Rental Property Renovations Make Sense</h3>

<p>Doing renovations on personal rental property makes sense if you are looking to increase the rent payments, if you plan on selling the unit soon or you want to make major changes to attract more tenants. For example, if you consistently have trouble renting out a studio (bachelor) apartment, it might make sense to convert that unit into a one-bedroom to attract tenants who like the idea of having a traditional-style bedroom.</p>

<h3>Research Before You Renovate</h3>

<p>Before you decide to undertake any renovations, take the time to do some market research; check your area classified ads to see what style of units seem to be in high demand and which ones look difficult to rent out. Often small low-cost renovations, such as adding in-suite laundry, installing a dishwasher or upgrading the bathroom can allow you to command higher rents for your personal rental property.</p>

<p>Another key factor in deciding whether or not personal rental property renovations are worth it is the time it will take you to recover your costs - for example, if you invest $3000 to improve the bathroom, how much will you need to raise the monthly rent to cover that cost (and will the market bear the higher rent)?</p>

<h3>Timing Your Rental Renovations</h3>

<p>The best time to upgrade your personal rental property is when you are between tenants - trying to do major renovations while the unit is occupied is a recipe for disaster. Anything that you or your contractors do that might be perceived as diminishing the habitability of the unit (such as temporary disruptions to the water or electrical service) can put you at risk of legal trouble from your current tenant.</p>

    <updated>2013-04-26T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.rentobo.com/blog/how-to-be-a-better-landlord</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="right" src="http://oblog.rentobo.com/images/wp_lease_image.png" title="Rental Agreement Form" ></p>

<p>When I went to look for my third apartment in the city, I started to learn that not
only is it important to look for a great apartment and location but that finding a
great <a href="http://www.williampaid.com/blog/index.php/2012/07/a-good-landlord-is-not-always-easy-to-find/">landlord</a> is equally as important. While “location, location, location” may be
the universal mantra of real estate agents and renters, my own personal mantra
during my apartment searches has been “landlord, landlord, landord!”
After having three different landlords in the span of three years, I can hopefully shed
some light on what landlords can do to better serve their renters.</p>

<h3>Know the laws of the city you are leasing in</h3>

<p>Each state and city has a landlord and tenant act that covers specific laws and
regulations regarding rent, security deposits, tenant rights, evictions, etc. My first
landlord printed a general Chicago <a href="http://www.williampaid.com/blog/index.php/2012/04/renting-an-apartment-top-10-questions-to-ask-a-landlord-before-signing-a-lease/">lease</a> and when my roommates and I asked
questions about late fees and certain laws that we might have to abide by, she
looked at us with a dumbstruck look of confusion. It was hard for us to take her
seriously when she didn’t even know the basic laws that she as a landlord was
expected to follow. Know the laws and be able to articulate them to your renters.</p>

<h3>Customize the lease</h3>

<p>Having a custom lease with personal instructions you want your renters to follow
is always helpful. My one landlord did this and he had a ‘move-out rider” attached
to the lease that detailed exactly what he wanted us to do when we moved out,
complete with a checklist. This was a great way for us to know exactly what was
expected of us so that our security deposit could be returned in full.</p>

<h3>Listen to our concerns</h3>

<p>One time both the front and back doors of my apartment building were broken and
I promptly called my landlord to let him know that I wanted it fixed. I called on a
Friday and no one came to fix either door until Monday morning. When it comes to
matters of safety, a landlord should respond in a timely manner. This is especially
important if the problem makes the apartment and your renters susceptible to
harm and theft. If it’s something as little as a broken dishwasher or as serious as
a broken front door, make sure you listen to your renter’s concerns and respond
appropriately. And for the safety of us renters, quickly!</p>

<h3>Be attentive (but respect our privacy!)</h3>

<p>Be there when you‘re needed but don’t hover. The landlord in my first apartment
kept some of her old things in our apartment and proceeded to let herself in to grab
things whenever she needed. This is not only illegal but also definitely a violation
of a renter’s privacy. Don’t barge in whenever you please. While we may be renting,
this is our apartment for the duration of the lease. Plus, we could be just getting out
of the shower!</p>

<h3>Offer Online Rent Payments</h3>

<p>Every landlord I’ve had has been very specific about how they want to receive rent.
The easiest way for renters is to pay rent online. For landlords, this will ensure that
rent is received on time each month. It is simple and convenient for renters and
after all, doesn’t a happy renter make a happy landlord?</p>

    <link href="http://www.rentobo.com/blog/why-tenant-screening-is-important/"/>
    <updated>2013-04-12T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.rentobo.com/blog/why-tenant-screening-is-important</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As a landlord, there can be many reasons as to taking a lax approach to screening tenants. But it is better to be safe than sorry. Some property owners, particularly the ones with smaller portfolios, tend to be more relaxed until <em>after</em> they’ve been bitten by a bad tenant or two. Here are some of the reasons why you should always screen a tenant properly <em>before</em> you pay the consequence.</p>

<h3>Past Evictions</h3>

<p>While a standard rental agreement requires that a potential tenant provides photo ID, proves their US residency status, and passes a criminal background, eviction and credit check, many landlords will accept the photo ID and residency status as "good enough" without finishing the entire screening process. Which is to say, they may not even check to see if a tenant has had an eviction.</p>

<p>Evictions are definitely a red flag, as they clearly show that at one point in time the tenant was legally required to vacate their residence. This can spell trouble down the line, especially if the potential tenant has had more than one eviction. By obtaining a credit report and eviction screening, the landlord will have the opportunity to discuss the past eviction with the potential tenant and make an informed decision based on the information they receive. This is a much better alternative to learning the hard way that a tenant isn't who they claim to be.</p>

<h3>Criminal Background Checks</h3>

<p>Criminal background checks are also very important when it comes to potential tenants. Once again, it is ultimately up to the landlord to make the final decision, but learning of a potential tenant's past criminal history can definitely be a deciding factor. If their criminal background check shows a history of theft or vandalism, they may not be the best candidate for tenancy. By learning beforehand, landlords can make their final decision based on facts rather than on instinct, saving themselves from potential trouble down the line.</p>

<p><strong><em>See Also:</em></strong> <a href="http://www.rentobo.com/blog/importance-of-up-to-date-leases/">The Importance of Up-To-Date Leases</a></p>

<h3>A Proper Denial Letter</h3>

<p> Additionally, by obtaining the required reports, landlords can send a denial letter based on specific information that they found during the background investigation. If a landlord denies a tenant based on something that is not clearly stated in the tenant qualifications section of the application, they could find themselves in violation of the Fair Housing Act.</p>

<h3>Take the Extra Steps</h3>

<p>While taking the extra steps to follow through on background and credit checks may seem unnecessary to landlords if they have an overall good feeling about their potential tenant, it is always best to follow the rental procedure step by step. This way everyone has their bases covered, and if all goes well, both parties can look forward to a successful landlord/tenant relationship.</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[4 Ways To Increase Property Revenue]]></title>
    <link href="http://www.rentobo.com/blog/4-ways-to-increase-revenue/"/>
    <updated>2013-03-28T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.rentobo.com/blog/4-ways-to-increase-revenue</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Many landlords and property managers struggle to find ways to keep pace with the growing overhead costs of their rental properties such as increased utility bills, rising insurance premiums and the never-ending demands for maintenance. Here are 4 ways you can increase the revenue from your rental property:</p>

<h3>Complete Simple Renovations</h3>

<p>Tenants like rental units that look updated. By completing simple, low-cost renovations and improvements like painting the walls, updating the light fixtures and replacing the toilet, faucets and electrical switch plates you can breathe new life into a dated rental unit and help attract and retain tenants, reducing your turnover costs. However, try to stay away from low quality updates to your property. Tenants will notice this lack of quality as they continue to inhabit your unit, and they will be less likely to renew.</p>

<h3>Perform Major Upgrades</h3>

<p>If you want to attract premium tenants to your properties, you need to provide them with premium features. Include things like an in-suite washer/dryer, a dishwasher, off-street parking, storage and/or a security system. Consider investing in some capital improvements to your property to make your unit look and feel like a luxury rental. In return, you can charge premium rent for your snazzy, upgraded unit.</p>

<h3>Raise The Rent</h3>

<p>It sounds easy, but you should verify your units' rents are priced reasonably according to the local market and neighborhood.
In most jurisdictions, regular rent increases are permitted. If you aren't bothering to increase your rent in line with regulations, you're leaving money on the table as inflation of maintenance services, regular upkeep and overhead expenses eat away from your bottom line.
Perhaps more importantly, pay attention to similar units in your market.
If your rent is noticeably lower, you probably will want to raise it.
While rent increases tend to be unpopular with tenants, most expect their property owners to charge current market value for their properties.</p>

<h3>Improve Customer Service</h3>

<p>Happy tenants are stable tenants. Think of your tenants as your customers, like any customer-service based business, the better you are at providing great customer service, the more successful your business will be. By responding quickly to <a href="http://www.rentobo.com/blog/responding-quickly-to-maintenance-requests/">maintenance requests</a>, being courteous and presenting yourself in a professional manner (even when you get the dreaded 3 a.m. phone call) your tenants will respond by treating you with respect. They will be more likely to pay their rent on time, take care of their unit and stay put, all things that help to boost your bottom line.</p>

<p>While increasing your rental income can seem like a daunting task, with a little effort and fine-tuning, you can raise the revenues of your rental or property management business.</p>

    <link href="http://www.rentobo.com/blog/importance-of-up-to-date-leases/"/>
    <updated>2013-03-26T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.rentobo.com/blog/importance-of-up-to-date-leases</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In most cities, both local and state jurisdictions regulate important property management issues such as collecting and returning security deposits, rental rate increases and the terms of the tenancy. Landlords need to maintain current leases and rental agreements for all their units in order to qualify for protection under landlord-tenant laws as well as to protect them against any hassles that can arise during the tenancy.</p>

<h3>The Basics of Rental Leases and Agreements</h3>

<p>Property management can be a complex business - landlords need to deal with both financial issues (collecting rent) and human rights issues (such as anti-discrimination laws). While many successful, long-term landlord-tenant relationships are based on nothing more than a simple handshake, unless there is a compelling reason to skip the paperwork it's always wise to get the rental terms in writing.</p>

<h3>What Can Go Wrong</h3>

<p>In the absence of a current rental agreement or an up-to-date lease, tenant complications or opportunistic scammers can wreak havoc on your property management business. Most tenants are decent, honest people, but you should take steps to protect yourself from professional scammers. There are some <a href="http://www.massrealestatelawblog.com/2012/02/19/massachusetts-landlords-be-aware-of-the-professional-tenant/">“professional tenants”</a> who are skilled at gaming the system by manipulating the rental laws to their advantage, causing their property owners and managers a great deal of grief and monetary loss.</p>

<p>For example, if you don't have a current, written lease, how can you prove the terms of the tenancy should you wind up in a legal battle? Unsavory tenants have been known to make wild claims against unsuspecting landlords in order to skip out on their rent, avoid paying for damages, or worse yet, to make a financial claim for damages against their landlord. A current rental agreement protects landlords and tenants by ensuring that all the terms of the tenancy are in writing. Everything related to the tenancy (particularly the financial details) should be covered in a lease or separate rider/addendum, such as the pet policy, amount and due date of rent and details about the security deposit and future rent increases.</p>

<p>By keeping up-to-date rental agreements and leases on file for all your rental properties, you can set expectations with your tenants, protect yourself and your business in the event that something goes wrong, and reduce your chances of falling victim to scams.</p>
