Rentobo is meant to be the easiest way for a landlord to manage the rental process. Part of that process is promoting to major rental search sites such as craigslist. If you have ever posted html or 'fancy' rental listings to craigslist, you may have encountered some difficulty.

Our new Chrome plug-in will eliminate that difficulty and allow you to post beautiful listings seamlessly, without the hassle.
