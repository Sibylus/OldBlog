Rentobo is the easiest way to manage the rental process. If you're a landlord, property manager or leasing agent, the first step in the process is marketing your vacancy effectively to find a great tenant quickly.

Using Rentobo, you can post to craigslist and many additional real estate search sites simultaneously. Just fill out your listing information once with us, and we automatically promote and distribute your listing across the web.

Today we're announcing a feature that is the fastest way to post real estate listings to craigslist - the [Rentobo Posting Helper](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/rentobo-posting-helper/fkiffbkghgniailieekodmgbomkefdgo?hl=en-US). The Rentobo Posting Helper is a Chrome extension that seamlessly integrates with Rentobo to let you post to craigslist with **one click**. Other browser support is coming soon, but in the meantime we highly suggest you give [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/) a shot. 

### Posting page on Rentobo

Once you've entered your listing details in Rentobo, under the **Promotions** tab, select under which geographic area you want the listing to display on craigslist (also be sure to take advantage of our [listing syndication](http://www.rentobo.com/benefits/) feature to promote your listing to other sites simultaneously). Alternatively, you can manually copy and paste the generated HTML to craigslist.

Once you click **Post to Craigslist** inside Rentobo, our extension will *automagically* populate the required fields on craigslist. Once this is done, you will see something similar to the following:

After that, just follow the standard craigslist verification and posting guidelines.

We'd appreciate your feedback on the extension -- [let us know](mailto:support@rentobo.com?subject=Chrome%20Extension) if we can make any improvements. Don't forget to tell your friends and colleagues and leave us a rating in the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/rentobo-posting-helper/fkiffbkghgniailieekodmgbomkefdgo?hl=en-US)!
