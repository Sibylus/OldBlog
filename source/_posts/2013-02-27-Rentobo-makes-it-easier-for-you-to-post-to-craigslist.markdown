Rentobo is the easiest way to manage the rental process. If you're a landlord, property manager or leasing agent, the first step in the process is marketing your vacancy effectively to find a great tenant quickly.

Using Rentobo, you can **post to craigslist and many additional real estate search sites simultaneously**. Just fill out your listing information once with us, and we automatically promote and distribute your listing across the web.

Today we're announcing a feature that is the fastest way to post real estate listings to craigslist - the [Rentobo Posting Helper](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/rentobo-posting-helper/fkiffbkghgniailieekodmgbomkefdgo?hl=en-US). The Rentobo Posting Helper is a Chrome extension that seamlessly integrates with Rentobo to let you post to craigslist with **one click**. Other browser support is coming soon, but in the meantime we highly suggest you give [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/) a shot. 

### How it works


Once you've entered your listing details in Rentobo, under the **Promotions** tab, select under which geographic area you want the listing to display on craigslist (also be sure to take advantage of our [listing syndication](http://www.rentobo.com/benefits/) feature to promote your listing to other sites simultaneously). Alternatively, you can manually copy and paste the generated HTML to craigslist.

Once you click **Post to Craigslist** inside Rentobo, our extension will *automagically* populate the required fields on craigslist. Once this is done, you will see something similar to the following:

After that, just follow the standard craigslist verification and posting guidelines.

Don't forget to tell your friends and colleagues and leave us a rating in the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/rentobo-posting-helper/fkiffbkghgniailieekodmgbomkefdgo?hl=en-US)!
