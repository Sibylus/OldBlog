Rentobo is meant to be the easiest way for a landlord to manage the rental process. Part of that process is promoting to major rental search sites such as craigslist. If you have ever posted html or 'fancy' rental listings to craigslist, you may have encountered some difficulty.

Our new Chrome plug-in will eliminate that difficulty and allow you to post beautiful listings seamlessly, without the hassle.

Once you have logged into Rentobo, under the promotions tab, you can select where you want your listing to display on craigslist (also be sure to take advantage of our [listing syndication](http://www.rentobo.com/benefits/) feature to promote your listing to other sites simultaneously.) Alternatively, you can also copy and paste the 'html' generated code to craiglist.
