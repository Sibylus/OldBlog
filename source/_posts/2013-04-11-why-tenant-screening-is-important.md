title: "Why Tenant Screening is Important"
---

In today's economy, with the nationâ€™s average credit score going down, more people are having a harder time finding a proper tenant. This can result in certain landlords taking a more lax approach when it comes to tenant screenings. The unfortunate reality for many hard working individuals is that there may be dings on their credit report due to financial hardship in the past. However, depending on the landlord, if the potential tenant can prove that they are currently bringing in an income that will allow them to pay their rent, certain discrepancies are overlooked. While credit reports can be an exception for some property owners and managers, it is still very important for them to screen potential tenants to ensure that they do not have past evictions or criminal records. 
 
### Past Evictions
 
While a standard rental agreement requires that a potential tenant provides photo ID, proves their US residency status, and passes a criminal background and credit check, many landlords will accept the photo ID and residency status as "good enough" without actually going through the process of the background or credit check. Whether or not the landlord is considering past credit as a deciding factor, a credit check will also show if a potential tenant has had past evictions.
 
Evictions are definitely a red flag, as they clearly show that at one point in time the tenant was legally required to vacate their residence. This can spell trouble down the line, especially if the potential tenant has had more than one eviction. By obtaining a credit report, the landlord will have the opportunity to discuss the past eviction with the potential tenant and make an informed decision based on the information they receive. This is a much better alternative to learning the hard way that a tenant isn't who they claim to be.
 
### Criminal Background Checks
 
Criminal background checks are also very important when it comes to potential tenants. Once again, it is ultimately up to the landlord to make the final decision, but learning of a potential tenant's past criminal history can definitely be a deciding factor. If their criminal background check shows a history of theft or vandalism, they may not be the best candidate for tenancy. By learning beforehand, landlords can make their final decision based on facts rather than on instinct, saving themselves from potential trouble down the line.

### A Proper Denial Letter
 
Additionally, by obtaining the required reports, landlords can send a denial letter based on specific information that they found during the background investigation. If a landlord denies a tenant based on something that is not clearly stated in the tenant qualifications section of the application, they could find themselves in violation of the Fair Housing Act.
 
### Take the Extra Steps
 
While taking the extra steps to follow through on background and credit checks may seem unnecessary to landlords if they have an overall good feeling about their potential tenant, it is always best to follow the rental procedure step by step. This way everyone has their bases covered, and if all goes well, both parties can look forward to a successful landlord/tenant relationship.
