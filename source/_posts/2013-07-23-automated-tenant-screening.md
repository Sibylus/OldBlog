These past few months have been exciting for Rentobo. Our team has been hard at work making improvements and implementing new features. We’re proud to announce Automated Tenant Screening - a better way to find the best tenant for your rental properties, along with a few other improvements to the application process.

## A Better Way to Screen Tenants

Rentobo has integrated with TransUnion to provide the easiest, most secure way to receive credit and criminal history reports from your applicants. Once an applicant authorizes your background check request, the process is done in a few minutes. Unlike competitors, this process requires no site inspection, lengthy approval process, or the myriad of hurdles required to jump in order to receive full credit reports. Since we never store your applicants’ social security numbers and have partnered with one of the largest credit reporting agencies in the world, renters can rest easy knowing their information is in safe hands. It’s also way better for renters because there’s no impact to their credit score by releasing their information to you.

## Using Automated Tenant Screening

All it takes to set up your listing for screening are a few answers about your listing and prospective applicants - that’s it. While renters pay a $35 application fee directly to Rentobo, screening is at no cost to you.

**Setting up Screening**

When you’re creating a new listing, follow our wizard and proceed to the “Credit / Screening Background Screening” step. Just answer a few questions about your property, save your changes, and we’ll do the rest. If you’re managing an existing listing, just navigate to “Credit / Screening Background Screening” from “Edit Listing.” [screenshot]

**Reviewing Credit Recommendations and Reports**

Once you receive applications to your listing, you can review the credit recommendation and full credit and criminal history details under each application. [screenshot]

## Improved Applications

We’ve listened to your feedback, and we’ve added several new features and streamlined the application process for prospective renters. In addition, we’ve also made it easier for group applicants to apply together. As a landlord, you’re now notified when an application is started, so you can follow up on the most promising leads right away. On your Rentobo dashboard, you’re now presented with a applications tab,  where you can view application statuses and details. [screenshot]
