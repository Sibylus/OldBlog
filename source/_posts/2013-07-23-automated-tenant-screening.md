It’s been an exciting few months for Rentobo. Our team has been hard at work making improvements and implementing new features to bring you the biggest release since we first launched Rentobo. 

We’re proud to announce Rentobo’s Automated Tenant Screening - a better way to find the best tenant for your rental properties, along with numerous other improvements to our application process and Rentobo overall.

### Free to Landlords, Managers, and Agents

As of today, Tenant Credit & Background Screening is available to all Rentobo users at no additional charge.  Simply enable Tenant Screening on your new or existing listing and you will automatically receive complete credit and criminal conviction reports with all applications to your listing.  Renters pay a $35 application fee directly to Rentobo to cover the cost of the report, enabling us to make screening available at no additional cost to you.

**Setting up Screening**

To receive screening reports for your new or existing listing, select the **“Enable TransUnion tenant screening reports”** checkbox on the new “Credit & Background Screening” page of your listing configuration.  Answer a few questions about your property and prospective tenants (so we can provide customized creditworthiness recommendations), save your changes, and we’ll do the rest.

**Reviewing Credit Recommendations and Reports**

Once you receive applications to your listing, you can review the credit recommendation and full credit and criminal history details under each application.

### A Better Way to Screen Tenants

Rentobo has integrated with TransUnion to provide the easiest, most secure way to receive credit and criminal history reports from your applicants. You can be up and running in the time it takes to check a box, with no additional configuration required. 

Thanks to TransUnion's proprietary technology, Rentobo users can bypass the site inspection, lengthy approval process, and the myriad of other obstacles usually required by most credit data providers. Since we never store your applicants’ social security numbers and have partnered with one of the largest credit reporting agencies in the world, renters can rest easy knowing their information is in safe hands. This process is also better for renters as all Rentobo screening reports are generated using a “soft inquiry,” which means unlike traditional credit inquiries there is no impact to the renters' credit scores.

### Improved Online Rental Applications

We’ve also added several new features and streamlined our [online rental application][2]. We’ve made it easier for groups of roommates or a prospect and a co-signer to apply with each other. We've improved our landlord notifications and added the ability for landlords to invite renters to apply directly through Rentobo. Finally, on your Rentobo dashboard you’re now presented with an Applications tab where you can view application statuses and details across all of your listings in one place.
