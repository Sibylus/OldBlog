Craigslist is one of the 10 highest ranking pages on the internet in the US, according to [alexa.com](http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/craigslist.org). Naturally, when building Rentobo, we decided to make it as convenient as possible to post your listing there. But craigslist is only the beginning. Market analysts have determined that 70% or more of new renters begin their searches [online](http://www.mynewplace.com/press-releases/magnetic-marketing-apartment-owners-can-snare-the-lions-share-of-renters-by-ramping-up-their-online-initiatives). With that in mind, we built our promotions tool to capture as much of that market, as efficiently as possible.

###How it works

The days of needing to be computer savvy to market your property are over. With Rentobo, even a novice can now market online by [using it to promote their listings](http://www.rentobo.com/howitworks). 

Using Rentobo, you can promote to craigslist and a host of other major rental search sites simultaneously and with just a few clicks. Unlike posting directly to craigslist, you can upload as many photos as youâ€™d like. Once you have created a listing, Rentobo will automatically save it into your management dashboard in case you need to use it at a later date.

###Accepting applications

When you create and post a listing with Rentobo, prospective tenants can submit applications online. This way, you can receive information such as employment history, salary information and rental history before you ever speak with them on the phone or see them in person. A lot of landlords and brokers enjoy having this information before moving forward with a full credit and background screening.

*We are also in the process of integrating full background and credit screening with Rentobo. If you would like to learn more and participate in our upcoming, limited beta program for this feature, click [here](http://www.rentobo.com/tenant_screening).
