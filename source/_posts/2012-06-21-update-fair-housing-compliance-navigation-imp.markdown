Hello all! Again, The Team at Rentobo is constantly looking to improve our site whenever and wherever possible. Some additions/enhancements in this update include:

### Fair And Equal Housing

{% img right /images/42304096-RentObo_Fair_housing002.png %}

[Rentobo.com][] now has various fair and equal housing logos and disclaimers
throughout the site. We feel this is a necessary step in our continued
commitment to ensuring a smooth and efficient user experience for our growing
community of landlords, brokers and rental tenants.

### Site Security

We now use SSL encryption in areas where sensitive data is collected. This is a
preliminary measure to protect our users against attack and other malicious
activity.

### Navigation

We have reworked our listing wizard a bit to make navigating your way through a
listing easier. Rentobo is meant to be easy and efficient for pros and
first-timers alike, so we have relied on very helpful feedback to make this
change.

Stay tuned for more updates!
