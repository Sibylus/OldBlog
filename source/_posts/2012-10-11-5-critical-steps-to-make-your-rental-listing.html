<div><span style="color: #222222;"><span style="">As the rental market thrives in the long aftermath of the housing crisis, it can be tough to shine in a competitive environment. Most of the time, just sticking to some solid general principles can make the real difference in your listings, and get the prospective tenants you want to respond to it.</span></span></div>
<p />
<div><span style="color: #222222;"><span style="">Keeping that in mind, we have put together 5 critical steps you can implement quickly to maximize the success of your search for tenants.</span></span></div>
<p />
<div>
<h6><span style="color: #222222;"><span style="">1. A Picture is Worth A Thousand Words&nbsp;</span></span></h6>
</div>
<div><span style="color: #222222;"><span style="">When it comes to photographs, you need to focus on 2 things---clarity and volume. People are visual. Your photographs can say things about an apartment that descriptive details simply cannot. Generally, the first thing people do when they view your listing is notice the photographs. Be sure to provide photographs that will enable your prospects to make informed decisions when considering your unit for the new home.&nbsp;</span></span></div>
<p />
<div><span style="color: #222222;"><span style="">The benefit to this is efficiency. If prospective tenants have a clearer vision of your property, it is likely they will be more serious about choosing it. Therefore, you are saving time for yourself and your prospective tenants by showing the unit to someone that is truly interested in living there.</span></span></div>
<p />
<div>
<h6><span style="color: #222222;"><span style="">2. Every Property Is Unique</span></span></h6>
</div>

<p />
<div><span style="color: #222222;"><span style="">Alongside photographs, fully describing your unit in the listing assists the prospective tenant in making their decision to view the property. This seems like a very simple concept, but what we've found is that many listings stick to the same limited format such as beds/baths, whether it's been renovated and not much else.&nbsp;</span></span></div>
<p />
<div><span style="color: #222222;"><span style="">Of course, listing core features is important, but this doesn't make your listing all that unique. To stand out, a mere mention of one or two additional character traits about your property can make a prospective tenant more excited. Claw-foot tubs? Don't leave it out. Old kitchen, newer appliances? Check. Interesting layout? You get the point.</span></span></div>
<p />
<div><span style="color: #222222;"><span style="">Remember, an excited prospect will turn in their paperwork more quickly, which will enable you to rent your unit faster. Listing a few extra details that distinguish your property will give it a personality that puts your listing above others. Your prospective tenants will be more likely to want your unique unit and want to call it home.</span></span></div>
<p />
<div>
<h6><span style="color: #222222;"><span style="">3. Every Neighborhood Has Character</span></span></h6>
</div>
<div><span style="color: #222222;"><span style="">The neighborhood in which a property is located can be as critical as the property itself. &nbsp;Many prospective tenants have an idea of the neighborhood/s in which they want to live, but just as many don't. For these people, you have a real opportunity to tell a story about what to expect if they want to live at your unit.</span></span></div>
<p />
<div><span style="color: #222222;"><span style="">Of course, if there are parks, cafes and restaurants nearby these are always good to mention. But what else? Ask yourself what is interesting within a half-mile radius of the property. This will assist prospective tenants in choosing your unit as it will give them information they may not have, and they will appreciate it. This is a particularly good piece of information for someone looking to relocate from out of state or abroad. Some examples could include a historic landmark or museum attraction...or better yet if the nearby park has a playground or dog area---have fun being creative.</span></span></div>
<p />
<div>
<h6><span style="color: #222222;"><span style="">4. Connect With Your Market</span></span></h6>
<span style="color: #222222;"><span style="">&nbsp;</span></span></div>
<div><span style="color: #222222;"><span style="">Aside from budget considerations, certain properties tend to attract people that other properties may not. Many people are looking for a connection to the place they will potentially call home. So use your words to connect with them. For instance, if students tend to gravitate to a listing you have, you may say, 'great for students.' Other examples you may see on listings include words like 'eclectic' or 'elegant.'&nbsp;</span></span></div>
<p />
<div><span style="color: #222222;"><span style="">Of course, be sure to follow fair housing laws and always avoid any preference or discrimination (which is also morally and ethically wrong.) A couple 'tag words' or 'labels' will do the trick, and the people that respond to your listing will generally be more excited about it.</span></span></div>
<p />
<div>
<h6><span style="color: #222222;"><span style="">5. Maximize Your Exposure</span></span></h6>
<span style="color: #222222;"><span style="">&nbsp;</span></span></div>
<div><span style="color: #222222;"><span style="">When marketing their listings, most brokers understand that few of the above mentioned tips will work if your unit is not given maximum exposure. You need to maximize your property's exposure to prospective tenants. While there are a host of different rental search sites where you can post your listing, posting on ONE of them can be insufficient, and posting on MANY of them individually can be time-consuming.</span></span></div>
<p />
<div><span style="color: #222222;"><span style="">Fortunately, <a href="http://www.rentobo.com" title="Rentobo | Rental Property Software" target="_blank">Rentobo</a> can help you with this dilemma. Our site has a free feature called listing syndication. When a property owner or broker lists their property with Rentobo, they can avoid the hassle of individually posting on multiple sites one by one, and post simultaneously. Many of our users are already doing this. Besides the obvious time-saving difference, the overwhelming consensus is that having more exposure leads to more serious and better qualified leads.&nbsp;</span></span></div>
<p />
<div><span style="color: #222222;"><span style="">One thing that is certain about our world, people are always going to need a place to live in and call home. With a rental market that is truly broad, competition is always going to be a factor. So do a little work on the front-end of the process to make the rest of it run more smoothly. Whether you are searching for your next 1 or 100 tenants, follow these steps and enjoy the rewards.</span></span></div>
