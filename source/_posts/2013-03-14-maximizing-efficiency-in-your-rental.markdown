If you are running a profitable business it can be easy to think that you are already efficient. The rental business is no different. Many profitable property owners use inefficient processes to get the job done. Here are some tips to help you increase your bottom line from the inside out.

###Promote correctly

There are two things to consider when optimizing your marketing efforts. You should keep your costs low (free if possible) and automate as much as you can. If you are using [Rentobo](http://www.rentobo.com), you can use our [listing syndication feature](http://www.rentobo.com/benefits#exposure) to post simultaneously to several major rental search sites, including craigslist. This feature is completely free of charge and we have gotten great feedback regarding the ease of use and the level of traffic generated. If you choose to supplement your marketing to other sources, stick with a strategy that will give you a proper return on your investment.

###Communicate properly

When communicating with your prospects, don’t get too carried away. Use a couple lines of communication, but manage them well. In other words, you don’t need to leave your mobile, office, fax and email address in your listings. It can be difficult to respond quickly to initial inquiries if you have to check too many sources. 

Stick to a primary business phone and/or email address that you can access quickly and frequently. Sometimes an excited prospect can become a lost prospect because your response time wasn’t satisfactory. Communicate efficiently, and your prospects will recognize that you are on top of things and will be more likely to rent from you.

###Trim the fat

More isn’t always better. Many profitable property owners and managers continue to invest in solutions that are unnecessary or do not perform well. There is no reason to generate 50 prospects if you only need 10 to find a high-quality tenant.

Examine each one of your traffic sources. For instance, if you run print ads in the classifieds for your rental units, get a sense of how much traffic those ads are actually generating. A simple way to do this is to ask each one of your prospects where they saw your listing. 

Also, take an inventory of your other expenses and see where you can make changes. Does your landscaping company overcharge for subpar work? Do you spend too much money each time you run a credit screen? Even if you pass on some of these expenses to your tenants, they will appreciate the lower costs of a more efficient process.

Maximizing efficiency is an ongoing process. The best methods available a decade ago may not be the effective methods for your business today. Many times, the difference between optimal and ‘good enough’ lies in your efficiency. With that in mind, make sure you consistently look for ways to improve.
