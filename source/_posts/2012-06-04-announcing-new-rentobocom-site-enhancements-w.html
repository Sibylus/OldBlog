<div style="">The Team at Rentobo would like to thank everyone in advance for a tremendous amount of awesome and helpful feedback! We have been working very hard to improve our site, and make it more valuable for our users. The Team has been listening to your needs, wants and desires, and have responded with these updates. More to come!</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div style=""><span style="color: #c64820; font-size: large;"><strong>Larger Photos</strong></span></div>
<p />
<div style=""><em>In response to user feedback</em> we have increased the size of the photos on the Rentobo listing page. We have also improved our strategy for processing and resizing uploaded photos to ensure they are displayed as&nbsp;consistently&nbsp;as possible on partner sites.</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div style=""><span style="color: #c64820; font-size: large;"><strong>Photo Uploads Made Simple</strong></span></div>
<p />
<div style="">Our users can now upload photos using a simple drag and drop feature. &nbsp;This means you can literally drag your chosen photos from your desktop folder into our upload box, and the photos will automatically upload. &nbsp;You can load one at a time, or highlight and drag several photos at once!</div>
<p />
<div style="">We have also made it easier for users to rearrange uploaded photos for each listing. &nbsp;We have employed a dragging feature which allows you to drag the photos you have already uploaded into their appropriate spots. &nbsp;This allows you to display your photos in any order, without restriction.</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div style=""><span style="color: #c64820; font-size: large;"><strong>Print and Go Tenant Handouts</strong></span></div>
<p />
<div style="">Users can now easily download a tenant handout, print and distribute them at showings and open houses in place of paper applications. &nbsp;The handouts convert to PDF format for easy printing. Tenant Handouts guide potential tenants back to Rentobo to apply and help tenants to remember your listing after a day of apartment hunting.</div>

<div style=""><span style="color: #c64820; font-size: large;"><strong>Introducing Apartable</strong></span></div>
<p />
<div style="">We are happy to introduce a new syndication partner for listing promotion:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.apartable.com" title="Apartable.com" target="_blank">Apartable.com.</a>&nbsp;</div>
<div style="">Rentobo listings will be displayed on Apartable with a special badge to let users know they can apply for the listing online with Rentobo.</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div style=""><span style="color: #c64820; font-size: large;"><strong>Other Improvements</strong></span></div>
<p />
<div style="">This release also includes a number of bugfixes and improvements to existing functionality including but not limited to:</div>
<div style="">
<ul>
<li style="margin-left: 15px;">Improved email notifications (with more information and links to review relevant information)</li>
