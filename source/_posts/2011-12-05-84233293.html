<p>Being an individual owner is not easy. Before you think about renting out your place there is the mess of regulations to comply with, and in some cities&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1998/03/01/realestate/for-the-small-landlord-all-problems-are-big.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm">upwards of 20 governmental agencies administer these regulations</a>. For some it can seem a lonely task, but you might be surprised how many other small landlords there are out there. Individuals own two thirds of the nation&rsquo;s 26 million unsubsidized rental units, and over 80 percent of structures with four units or less.</p>
<p>Renting out an apartment is not easy either. Owners must worry about property maintenance, figuring out what rent to charge, advertising the property, screening tenants, and preparing and signing a lease. In San Francisco, vacancy rates are so low that owners reportedly are receiving up to&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/02/us/in-apartment-hunt-looking-isnt-free.html?_r=1&amp;src=recg">250 applications per listing</a>. That&rsquo;s a lot of paper to manage! Even before receiving these applications, owners have to be careful how they advertise the property, and what questions they ask prospective tenants, either on the application or in person. For starters, the&nbsp;<a href="http://hud.gov/fairhousing">Federal Fair Housing Act</a>&nbsp;makes it illegal to discriminate based on a host of factors - race, color, national origin, religion, sex, family status, or disability. But there are state and city laws as well. Additionally, brokers maintain lists of&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/29/nyregion/29appraisal.html">no-no phrases</a>. Is your place a &ldquo;bachelor pad&rdquo;&nbsp;or a &ldquo;fisherman&rsquo;s retreat,&rdquo;&nbsp;in a &ldquo;traditional neighborhood,&rdquo; &ldquo;perfect for shares or families&rdquo;? You might think twice before advertising your unit using any of those phrases.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the solution? What can you do to make the process easier? Rentobo simplifies the entire process. Using Rentobo you can post your ad to Craigslist with as many photos as you would like, drive prospective tenants to fill out an application and do the credit check online without worrying about all the legal mumbo-jumbo, and finally have the tenant sign the lease online.</p>
<p>The next time 200 people come to your apartment and want to rent, you can welcome them all, and not have to worry about managing all those paper applications!</p>
