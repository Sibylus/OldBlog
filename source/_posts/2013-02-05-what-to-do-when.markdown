Managing rental properties can be like running any other business. There are ups and downs in the market, and sometimes a landlord is forced to make adjustments. Life is easy when you have an abundance of eager prospects, but what do you do when interest dries up? Here are some simple fixes that can get your vacancy filled.

### Always assess what you should be charging

One thing to remember is that a unit is only as valuable as someone is willing to pay for it. While you might not want your rental unit to be a steal-of-a-deal, you don’t want to price yourself out of the competition. If you have trouble finding a tenant, reassess the prices of similar property in your area. Be prepared to lower your rent if the data is convincing enough. If you stay competitive, people will notice.

### Encourage lease renewals

Keeping your tenants happy increases the likelihood they will renew their lease, sparing you the time and cost associated with finding new tenants. The costs associated with turning over a rental property can be significant (lost rent, marketing/broker’s fees, maintenance, etc.) and [can possibly exceed $4,000](http://www.naahq.org/blog/lists/Posts/Post.aspx?ID=222) according to an analysis by the National Apartment Association. Timely responses to maintenance requests and convenient perks like online rental payments are ways to improve tenant satisfaction and your bottom line.

### Consider an inexpensive update

If your rent is competitive, eventually people will view it. Pay attention to what they say. If the kitchen cabinets are in rough shape, get them fixed. If the carpet is truly repulsive, sometimes a steamvac and shampoo isn’t enough. Change it out. In a situation where your prospects have a choice, they will be looking for a place they can call home, not just rent that is easy on the wallet.

### Offer incentives for referrals

Sometimes the best way to keep your vacancies filled is to have your current tenants fill vacancies for you. Prospects tend to trust people that they know, so incentivize your renters for finding your next tenant. To do this, ask your tenants if they know someone that may be interested, and that you would be willing to provide a finder’s fee for helping you out. This may amount to a discount on their final month’s rent, or a gift card. If you have a positive relationship with your tenant, they are likely to give you a good referral.

### Pay for utilities

Sometimes it might be an insignificant cost that keeps your prospects from renting your property. Often a prospective tenant will enjoy not having to pay for utilities like electric or gas. If the amount is too unreasonable, consider paying for a predetermined amount of time, say six months or a year. This will ensure that you keep your expenses at bay in the case of a long term tenant.
