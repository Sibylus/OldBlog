One of the biggest dilemmas that every property owner may face is the question of whether or not to rent to their friends. On one hand, the idea of renting out a unit to a friend is very attractive; after all, these aren't just people who you happen to know, they're actually people who you like and trust. On the other hand, many people swear by the old adage that you shouldn't mix business with pleasure, and many great friendships have been ruined when money muddies the waters.

If you're thinking of renting to your friends, here are three things you should consider:
 
1. Why are you thinking of renting to friends? Perhaps you're having a tough time finding good tenants for your unit and you see your friends as nice, responsible people who will make great tenants. Or perhaps you feel like you need to help your nomadic buddy out; after all, the poor guy can't seem to catch a break when it comes to landlords - that's why he's moved 5 times in the last few years (right)?
 
2. Can you wear both hats - friend and landlord? Renting to your friends means that you'll need to collect rent from them, fix their toilet and confront them on any damage or disruptive behavior - are you up for that?
 
3. Could you evict your friend? The unfortunate reality of the rental business is that sometimes things get ugly and property owners need to be the bad guy/gal and serve an eviction notice to a tenant. If that tenant happens to be a friend, could you do it?
 
If you do opt to cross the friend-tenant boundary and rent to a friend, it's important to maintain the same tenant screening standards that you would with anybody. Don't give in to the urge to skip a credit check and forego references based on your friendship. Remember that no matter who you rent your unit to, your livelihood depends on your tenants paying their rent (in full and on time), maintaining the property in good order and behaving in a way that is respectful to both the other tenants in the building and the surrounding neighbors. Lay out these expectations up front and maintain them with your tenant/friend; this will help to both preserve your friendship and your business.
