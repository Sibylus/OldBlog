Being an individual owner is not easy. Before you think about renting out your
place there is the mess of regulations to comply with, and in some
cities [upwards of 20 governmental agencies administer these regulations][]. For
some it can seem a lonely task, but you might be surprised how many other small
landlords there are out there. Individuals own two thirds of the nation’s 26
million unsubsidized rental units, and over 80 percent of structures with four
units or less.

Renting out an apartment is not easy either. Owners must worry about property
maintenance, figuring out what rent to charge, advertising the property,
screening tenants, and preparing and signing a lease. In San Francisco, vacancy
rates are so low that owners reportedly are receiving up to [250 applications per listing][].
That’s a lot of paper to manage! Even before receiving these
applications, owners have to be careful how they advertise the property, and
what questions they ask prospective tenants, either on the application or in
person. For starters, the [Federal Fair Housing Act][] makes it illegal to
discriminate based on a host of factors - race, color, national origin,
religion, sex, family status, or disability. But there are state and city laws
as well. Additionally, brokers maintain lists of [no-no phrases][]. Is your
place a “bachelor pad” or a “fisherman’s retreat,” in a “traditional
neighborhood,” “perfect for shares or families”? You might think twice before
advertising your unit using any of those phrases.

So what’s the solution? What can you do to make the process easier? Rentobo
simplifies the entire process. Using Rentobo you can post your ad to Craigslist
with as many photos as you would like, drive prospective tenants to fill out an
application and do the credit check online without worrying about all the legal
mumbo-jumbo, and finally have the tenant sign the lease online.

The next time 200 people come to your apartment and want to rent, you can
welcome them all, and not have to worry about managing all those paper
applications!
