<p>Hello all! Again, The Team at Rentobo is constantly looking to improve our site whenever and wherever possible. Some additions/enhancements in this update include:</p>
<p><span style="color: #c64820;">Fair And Equal Housing</span>&nbsp;[[posterous-content:dgtqlufjIAtyijnpanDI]]</p>
<p><a href="http://www.rentobo.com" title="Rentobo.com" target="_blank">Rentobo.com</a> now has various fair and equal housing logos and disclaimers throughout the site. We feel this is a necessary step in our continued commitment to ensuring a smooth and efficient user experience for our growing community of landlords, brokers and rental tenants.</p>
<p>[[posterous-content:FxreBCBDieGuoxdvGuzg]]</p>
<p><span style="color: #c64820;">Site Security</span></p>
<p>We now use SSL encryption in areas where sensitive data is collected. This is a preliminary measure to protect our users against attack and other malicious activity.</p>
<p><span style="color: #c64820;">Navigation</span></p>
<p>We have reworked our listing wizard a bit to make navigating your way through a listing easier. Rentobo is meant to be easy and efficient for pros and first-timers alike, so we have relied on very helpful feedback to make this change.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stay tuned for more updates!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-The Team at Rentobo</p>
