The Team at Rentobo would like to thank everyone in advance for a tremendous
amount of awesome and helpful feedback! We have been working very hard to
improve our site, and make it more valuable for our users. The Team has been
listening to your needs, wants and desires, and have responded with these
updates. More to come!

## Larger Photos

In response to user feedback we have increased the size of the photos on the
Rentobo listing page. We have also improved our strategy for processing and
resizing uploaded photos to ensure they are displayed as consistently as
possible on partner sites. 

### Photo Uploads Made Simple

Our users can now upload photos using a simple drag and drop feature.  This
means you can literally drag your chosen photos from your desktop folder into
our upload box, and the photos will automatically upload.  You can load one at a
time, or highlight and drag several photos at once!

We have also made it easier for users to rearrange uploaded photos for each
listing.  We have employed a dragging feature which allows you to drag the
photos you have already uploaded into their appropriate spots.  This allows you
to display your photos in any order, without restriction.

### Print and Go Tenant Handouts

Users can now easily download a tenant handout, print and distribute them at
showings and open houses in place of paper applications.  The handouts convert
to PDF format for easy printing. Tenant Handouts guide potential tenants back to
Rentobo to apply and help tenants to remember your listing after a day of
apartment hunting.

### Introducing Apartable

We are happy to introduce a new syndication partner for listing
promotion: [Apartable.com.][] 

Rentobo listings will be displayed on Apartable with a special badge to let
users know they can apply for the listing online with Rentobo.

### Other Improvements 

This release also includes a number of bugfixes and improvements to existing
functionality including but not limited to:

- Improved email notifications (with more information and links to review 
relevant information)
-   Better reliability when posting to Craigslist by integrating listing
    descriptions copied from MS Word
-   Added open house times to Craigslist posts (when applicable)
-   Simplified tenant signup when applying for a listing
-   Added additional scheduling options for open houses shorter than 30 minutes

Again, our team is working around the clock to make Rentobo.com the most
efficient, user-friendly way to find and sign new tenants for your rental
property. If there are any questions or concerns you have while using our site,
feel free to let us know at:
