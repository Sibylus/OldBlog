title: "Top 3 Cities to Rent vs. Buy"

The average homeowner buys and sells a home [every 5-7 years][1], so it is important to examine the costs over that period of time. Across the country, it is now less expensive to [buy a home versus renting one][2] (which is great for landlords looking to profit on their investment). However, if a 20% down payment, inability to obtain financing, or other reasons make homeownership not in the cards, there are some markets where renting could be far more attractive.

### Methodology

We took the most recent averages for a market (home sales price and rent price for a 2 bedroom residence) and compiled data based off of the following terms:

* 2 bedroom residence
* 20% down payment
* 3.5% mortgage interest
* Property tax for the listed market
* 6 years of tenancy
* Other miscellaneous considerations, such as closing costs and maintenance costs (we used [this tool][3] to help with our calculations).

In addition to our input of raw data, we considered other more realistic factors, such as the typical “for sale” home being larger and more luxurious than the typical rental. With these factors in mind, we have put together three of the best cities you can live in if you are looking to rent instead of purchasing a home.

***For Landlords:*** [The case for single-family rental investment][4]

### Manhattan, NY - (2 bedroom $850,000 sales price vs $3,650/mo rent) 
_$3,673 savings/year for renters_

Manhattan is a densely populated island, and is the most expensive of the five boroughs 
of New York. In addition to the towering skyscrapers already present there, there is constant new construction. Even so, the vacancy rate is hovering [around 1.5%][5] due to improving employment in a notoriously high demand area.

A modest 2 bedroom apartment in Manhattan will cost you around $850,000, which is much more comparable to the typical apartment for rent, but if you are looking for something more luxurious, expect your costs on either end to skyrocket (the actual average luxury 2 bedroom apartment was [$1.25 million in 2012][6]).

### San Francisco, CA - (2 bedroom $725,000 sales price vs $2,900/mo rent)
_$2,081 savings/year for renters_

The temperate San Francisco climate and high salaries due to the tech industry have driven a large number of workers to a tiny geographical area (less than 47 square miles for over 800,000 people),  so in the last decade San Francisco has become a very expensive place to live. A lot of people looking to live in San Francisco-proper have opted instead to live in nearby San Jose or Oakland, where prices are cheaper but rising. 

San Francisco is a market with built-in demand and short supply, due to high population density but a shortage of skyscrapers. In fact, the only major US city with a higher population density in the entire US is New York. 

### Honolulu, HI - (2 bedroom $465,000 sales price vs $1,725/mo rent)
_$446 savings/year for renters_

Honolulu, HI is an island -- like Manhattan -- that is as much a destination for tourists as it is a hometown for locals. Many homes purchased here are used for secondary or vacation homes, and that secondary market has added to the demand.
