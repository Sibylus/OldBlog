The digital age has made various aspects of the property rental industry easier for businesses to maintain their day-to-day job. This includes the rental application. Online rental applications help streamline the application portion of the rental process and provide various benefits that paper versions cannot.

### Time Saver

The amount of time you save by switching to online rental applications is the number one reason why property managers choose this option. Online applications allow the potential resident to quickly find out if they are eligible as a renter. After the credit and background checks come back, you can approve the resident and allow them to log in to the website and sign the apartment lease in a matter of minutes. Since electronic signatures are now considered as legally binding as written ones, the tenant can easily sign all required documents from the comfort of their home.

### Ease of Use

Internet usage is more popular now than ever, and potential renters regularly search online for available rental properties. Online rental applications allow potential renters to fill out and send in the application as soon as they find your listing online. Offering the convenience of online rental applications puts you ahead of the competition and increases the amount of applications you receive. In addition, your listing will reach a greater number of tech-savvy, young tenants who know you are the type of landlord they can easily work with.

### Better Organization and Less Clutter

Electronic applications drastically reduce the amount of paper flow you have to deal with. Rather than wading through a filing cabinet packed with individual leases, instantly pull the desired lease up on your computer. Also, you can easily make changes to your lease and make it available to residents immediately.

### Getting Started

Getting started with online rental applications is a relatively simple process with various online resources designed to help property owners new to electronic applications. Typically, you can choose from a wide array of pre-made templates for the application or customize your very own. Another option is to upload the current application you are using and make it available electronically for potential renters.

Computers, the Internet and technology in general have greatly simplified and improved the way potential tenants find properties. By implementing electronic applications, you ensure your business won't miss out on all the benefits provided by online applications.
