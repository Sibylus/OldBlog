While property owners in high demand areas have less difficulty recruiting tenants, investors who own rental units in areas with high vacancy rates may need to offer rental concessions to both current and prospective tenants. If your rental property is located in an area where there are more vacancies than there are qualified tenants, providing perks to your renters can make the difference between maintaining your rental cash flow or having your units sit empty.

###What Concessions Should You Offer?

A Los Angeles landlord recently made headlines with her unique rental concession; Sandy Zalegens, a property investor and animal rescue advocate, recently offered new tenants a $150 discount on their monthly $950 rent on the condition that they adopt Big Louie, a 80-pound Pit Bull dog who [needed a home](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/17/pitbulls-landlord-discounts-rent_n_1790737.html])

Although Zalegens' concession did help her find a great tenant for her unit, most property owners cannot (and likely should not) be quite that creative when it comes to providing incentives to attract tenants. Nevertheless, it might not hurt to think ‘outside of the box’ when it comes to offering concessions. Consider what you can offer, focusing first on low-cost ideas such as allowing pets, providing free parking or including cable TV service. Enticing tenants by including utilities is another popular perk, as it saves tenants the hassle of activating their own utility accounts while the cost to the landlord is usually manageable.

###Concessions Can Help Improve Retention Rates

Rental concessions aren't just for new tenants --- by offering "loyalty rewards" to stable tenants, you will cut your vacancy rates as well as eliminate the costs associated with tenant turnover. Ongoing retention incentives can include deals like "pay 12 months, get the 13th month rent-free," and discounted rates on laundry tokens and cards (if you offer a tenant laundry room). You can also research bulk discounts on sports tickets, fitness center passes and grocery gift cards to give as "thank you" gifts to stable tenants.
 
The type of concessions you offer will depend on the demands of both your market and your tenants. The bottom line is that it is better to offer rental concessions for continued cash-flow than to have your rental properties remain vacant.
