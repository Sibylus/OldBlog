  <div class="entry-content"><p>Whether you manage your basement suite, a single property or a number of rental units, responding quickly to maintenance requests from your tenants is important. One of the primary reasons why people choose to live in a rental property is the freedom from responsibility for repairs, maintenance and upkeep - from the tenant&#8217;s perspective, that&#8217;s your job. Doing repairs in a timely manner can have a big impact on the bottom line of your rental business, affecting everything from the total cost of the repair to your tenant turnover rates.</p>

<h3>Quality Tenants Expect Customer Service</h3>

<p>Great tenants are in great demand (and in most cases, they know it.) This means that even in markets with extremely low vacancy rates, top-tier tenants who are willing to pay a premium for their rental unit expect their landlord or property manager to respond quickly to maintenance issues.</p>

<p><strong>See also:</strong> <a href="http://www.rentobo.com/blog/what-to-do-when/">How to fill a tough rental vacancy</a></p>

<p>Even if the problem seems minor to you, from the perspective of your tenant, the longer they need to wait for a repair to be completed, the more time they have to reconsider if they want to continue living in your unit. Failing to respond quickly to maintenance requests is the rental equivalent to leaving someone on hold; the longer the customer needs to wait, the more agitated they&#8217;ll become. Put them on hold long enough and chances are good they&#8217;ll hang up and take their money elsewhere.</p>

<h3>A Quick Response Can Prevent Bigger Problems</h3>

<p>Unless you happen to have a tenant who is skilled in building maintenance, you need to do a hands-on assessment of your property as soon as your tenant contacts you with a repair request. Often tenants can&#8217;t (or won&#8217;t) bother to investigate a problem with their unit. Again, the tenants expect you to do that. Responding quickly to a call from your tenant can save you the hassle and costs of a major repair. After all, that tiny leak in the ceiling could be the sign of a pipe that&#8217;s ready to burst, or that plug that stopped working could be the result of rodents eating away at your electrical wiring.</p>

<p>By providing your tenants with a quick response to a call for repairs, you can help keep your paying tenants happy (which will improve your retention rates) and catch small problems before they turn into major maintenance headaches, saving you both time and money.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Property owners in college towns face unique challenges with their rental properties. Owning an attractive, well-priced investment suite in a high-demand area near a school can result in healthy profits. However, renting to students often means dealing with seasonal leases, subletting and co-tenancy between roommates.</p>

<h3>Students Expect Digital Marketing</h3>

<p>The days of posting handwritten signs on student bulletin boards are gone; today&#8217;s students are tech-savvy and focused on digital content. To market your off-campus housing to student tenants, you need to <a href="http://www.rentobo.com">advertise your rentals online</a>. There are many free or low-cost listing options for local landlords and with a service that syndicates your listing, you can post to them <a href="http://www.rentobo.com/benefits#exposure">simultaneously</a>.</p>

<p>In addition to promoting to national rental sites, consider advertising online to local online classifieds, such as the major college&#8217;s student newspaper. Other tech-friendly features that can help make you a preferred landlord are the option of online rent payments, <a href="http://www.rentobo.com/benefits#applications">online rental applications</a> and the availability of high-speed Internet on the rental property. Many colleges and universities often have their own portals for students searching for off-campus housing, so you should advertise on those as well.</p>

<h3>Catering To Student Tenants</h3>

<p>Student tenants often want to either lease a property for the school year (usually September to April) or have the option to sublet the unit during times when they are away from school. Property owners who target student renters need to create student-friendly leases that accommodate their schedule. With the right lease, many students remain with the same landlord for the duration of their degree and postgraduate programs. Include student-friendly clauses like allowing roommates, subletting and discounts for times when the unit that appeal to student tenants.</p>

<p>With the right tools and knowledge, property owners can successfully attract and retain responsible, stable student tenants to their off-campus housing. Post-secondary students are attracted to rentals with student-friendly rental terms that are close to campus, convenient to transit, shopping and other services. Advertise your off-campus housing where students will see it - on multiple rental housing sites, local online classifieds and through housing portals on college websites.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A dull property can make it more difficult to find a good tenant. However, for many landlords, updating your rental property can be a daunting task. Not all of us are designers or decorators, and sometimes you just don&#8217;t know where to start.   Fortunately, there are many low-cost things you can do to make your property more attractive to prospective tenants. Here are some tips to get you started.</p>

<h3>Focus on the kitchen and bath first</h3>

<p>The kitchen and the bathroom are the two most important rooms in your unit. Prospects tend to care about them the most, and they provide the most bang for your buck when you update them. If you&#8217;re on a budget, the proper approach is to <em>update</em> not <em>modernize</em>.</p>

<p>In other words, don&#8217;t spend too much money on a more beautiful alternative, when a cheaper option can get the job done. For instance, bathroom tile can run as low as $1 a sheet or as high as $100 a square foot. In most cases, the cheaper option will still give your bath a fresh vibe that prospects will enjoy.</p>

<h3>New paint, new look</h3>

<p>A fresh coat of paint can do wonders for a bland-looking unit. With that said, the actual task of painting can be time consuming and stressful if you get carried away. There are a couple simple solutions to this dilemma:</p>

<ol>
<li>Select a color that is neutral and stick with that color throughout the unit.</li>
<li>Allow your prospective tenant to paint the unit themselves.</li>
</ol>


<p>The second option can be a huge selling point for your property. Prospective tenants love to visualize their potential new space, and the ability to paint will get their imaginative juices flowing.</p>

<h3>Small changes, big impressions</h3>

<p>If you have a bit of decorator in you, you can still be very budget conscious when updating your unit. Think of small fixes that will leave a big visual impression. Instead of changing your entire cabinet, switch out the knobs and handles. Update that old brass faucet with a polished stainless steel. Attach a new showerhead in the bathrooms.</p>

<p>In some cases, the originality of your fixtures can actually be a selling point. In this case, you can take them off, polish them properly (check out <a href="http://www.hgtv.com">HGTV</a> or <a href="http://www.doityourself.com">DIY</a> for tips on how to this,) and reattach them. Again, it isn&#8217;t difficult to make a big impact on a space with simple, eye-catching updates.</p>

<p>The best way to approach a property update is to get multiple perspectives. If prospective tenants come to look at your property, pay attention to their feedback. A helpful broker may be willing to give you some tips as well. With a better perspective, you can apply our tips as mentioned to update your unit without breaking the bank.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Rentobo is the easiest way to manage the rental process. If you&#8217;re a landlord, property manager or leasing agent, the first step in the process is marketing your vacancy effectively to find a great tenant quickly.</p>

<p>Using Rentobo, you can <strong>post to craigslist and many additional real estate search sites simultaneously</strong>. Just fill out your listing information once with us, and we automatically promote and distribute your listing across the web.</p>

<p>Today we&#8217;re announcing a feature that is the fastest way to post real estate listings to craigslist - the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/rentobo-posting-helper/fkiffbkghgniailieekodmgbomkefdgo?hl=en-US">Rentobo Posting Helper</a>. The Rentobo Posting Helper is a Chrome extension that seamlessly integrates with Rentobo to let you post to craigslist with <strong>one click</strong>. Other browser support is coming soon, but in the meantime we highly suggest you give <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/">Google Chrome</a> a shot.</p>

<h3>How it works</h3>

<p>Once you&#8217;ve entered your listing details in Rentobo, under the <strong>Promotions</strong> tab, select under which geographic area you want the listing to display on craigslist (also be sure to take advantage of our <a href="http://www.rentobo.com/benefits/">listing syndication</a> feature to promote your listing to other sites simultaneously). Alternatively, you can manually copy and paste the generated HTML to craigslist.

<p>Once you click <strong>Post to Craigslist</strong> inside Rentobo, our extension will <em>automagically</em> populate the required fields on craigslist. Once this is done, you will see something similar to the following:</p>

<p>After that, just follow the standard craigslist verification and posting guidelines.</p>

<p>We&#8217;d appreciate your feedback on the extension &#8211; <a href="mailto:support@rentobo.com?subject=Chrome%20Extension">let us know</a> if we can make any improvements.
