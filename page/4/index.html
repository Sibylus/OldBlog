  <div class="entry-content"><p>As a landlord, there can be many reasons as to taking a lax approach to screening tenants. But it is better to be safe than sorry. Some property owners, particularly the ones with smaller portfolios, tend to be more relaxed until <em>after</em> they’ve been bitten by a bad tenant or two. Here are some of the reasons why you should always screen a tenant properly <em>before</em> you pay the consequence.</p>

<h3>Past Evictions</h3>

<p>While a standard rental agreement requires that a potential tenant provides photo ID, proves their US residency status, and passes a criminal background, eviction and credit check, many landlords will accept the photo ID and residency status as &#8220;good enough&#8221; without finishing the entire screening process. Which is to say, they may not even check to see if a tenant has had an eviction.</p>

<p>Evictions are definitely a red flag, as they clearly show that at one point in time the tenant was legally required to vacate their residence. This can spell trouble down the line, especially if the potential tenant has had more than one eviction. By obtaining a credit report and eviction screening, the landlord will have the opportunity to discuss the past eviction with the potential tenant and make an informed decision based on the information they receive. This is a much better alternative to learning the hard way that a tenant isn&#8217;t who they claim to be.</p>

<h3>Criminal Background Checks</h3>

<p>Criminal background checks are also very important when it comes to potential tenants. Once again, it is ultimately up to the landlord to make the final decision, but learning of a potential tenant&#8217;s past criminal history can definitely be a deciding factor. If their criminal background check shows a history of theft or vandalism, they may not be the best candidate for tenancy. By learning beforehand, landlords can make their final decision based on facts rather than on instinct, saving themselves from potential trouble down the line.</p>

<p><strong><em>See Also:</em></strong> <a href="http://www.rentobo.com/blog/importance-of-up-to-date-leases/">The Importance of Up-To-Date Leases</a></p>

<h3>A Proper Denial Letter</h3>

<p> Additionally, by obtaining the required reports, landlords can send a denial letter based on specific information that they found during the background investigation. If a landlord denies a tenant based on something that is not clearly stated in the tenant qualifications section of the application, they could find themselves in violation of the Fair Housing Act.</p>

<h3>Take the Extra Steps</h3>

<p>While taking the extra steps to follow through on background and credit checks may seem unnecessary to landlords if they have an overall good feeling about their potential tenant, it is always best to follow the rental procedure step by step. This way everyone has their bases covered, and if all goes well, both parties can look forward to a successful landlord/tenant relationship.</p>

<h3>How To Get Started</h3>

<time datetime="2013-04-04T00:00:00-07:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Apr 4<span>th</span>, 2013</time>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last year, 367,000 single-family homes were sold in the US. This number is the highest since 2009, and nearly a 20% <a href="http://www.valueline.com/Markets/Commentary.aspx?id=14076">jump from 2011</a>. This is good news to participants in the housing market, but what are some of the economic drivers behind some of these purchases?</p>

<p>Investment firms such as <a href="http://www.blackstone.com/">Blackstone Group</a> and <a href="http://data.cnbc.com/quotes/SBY">Silver Bay Realty Trust</a> have allocated billions of dollars of capital towards the single-family market, with a focus on distressed and/or bank-owned foreclosure properties. The purpose of this investment is to buy in bulk, renovate if necessary, and rent out their inventory while the housing market rebounds. Jade Rahmani, an analyst with KBW, says “By some accounts, $6-9 billion has been raised or committed, suggesting potential acquisitions of 40,000-90,000 properties.” This accounts for roughly 15% of unsold REO (real estate owned) <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/100366417">housing units</a>.</p>

<p>Traditionally, a lot of real estate investment firms <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887324034804578346800317118568.html">had shied away from the single family market (paywall)</a> due to the complexities of managing geographically dispersed properties. We&#8217;re developing Rentobo&#8217;s next-generation <a href="http://www.rentobo.com">rental property management software platform</a> with this in mind; whether you&#8217;re a single family landlord or a large organization with hundreds or thousands of units under management, we&#8217;re building the best experience possible for finding and connecting with the best tenants for your property.</p>

<p>That is a big number that actually helps the rental market more than the housing market. Houses are being purchased, but the a large number of their owners are renting them out instead of actually living in them. Non-investment homeownership in the <a href="http://www.census.gov/housing/hvs/files/qtr412/q412press.pdf">US is down to 65%</a>, which is the lowest it has been in 15 years. Consider these factors:</p>

<ul>
<li>When people lose their homes to foreclosures, <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrapoza/2012/04/04/how-single-family-home-investing-can-save-the-housing-market/">60% end up renting a single-family home</a>, with another 23% renting an apartment.</li>
<li>Over the last five years, foreclosures have caused over <a href="http://www.realestateeconomywatch.com/2012/04/single-family-rentals-now-exceed-multifamily/">3 million homeowners</a> and put them into the rental market.</li>
<li>There are an estimated <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrapoza/2012/04/04/how-single-family-home-investing-can-save-the-housing-market/2/">6.3 million Generation Y</a> aspiring renters that currently live with their friends or at home while they financially establish themselves in a tough job market. These kids are expected to enter the rental market within the next 5 years.</li>
<li><a href="http://makinsensebabe.com/number-of-new-us-single-family-homes-sales-fell-in-december-2012-while-home-prices-rose-so-basically-nobody-can-afford-a-home/">22% of borrowers are are “underwater”</a> whereas a healthy economy would put that number at around 5%. For some of these people, without a lot of help, they will soon enter the rental market as well.</li>
<li>The U.S. has solid demographics for homeownership, but new housing supply is <a href="http://www.blackstone.com/news-views/blackstone-blog/blackstone-creates-national-single-family-rental-home-platform">63% below the historical average.</a></li>
</ul>


<p>Indicators such as these are perhaps the reason why <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/46538421/Warren_Buffett_on_CNBC_I_d_Buy_Up_A_Couple_Hundred_Thousand_Single_Family_Homes_If_I_Could">Warren Buffett</a> said “I’d buy up a couple thousand single-family homes” if he found it reasonable to do so. He believes that if you do buy a single-family home in which to live, make sure you get a 30 year mortgage (to keep your monthly cash expenses minimized) and refinance when rates are better.</p>

<p>For a family, a single-family unit is an attractive rental option. Families prefer to live in single-family units as opposed to large multi-family buildings. For property owners, these residents tend to be more stable and stay longer than a typical young single tenant.</p>

<p>What all of this means is that now is a better time than ever to consider renting out a single-family homes and becoming a landlord. Rates are low, the demand is not only high but inevitable, and in most markets, current mortgage payments are <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/monthly-rent-vs-monthly-mortgage-payment-2013-1">lower than rental premiums</a> (which means money in your pocket).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Craigslist is one of the 10 highest ranking pages on the internet in the US, according to <a href="http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/craigslist.org">alexa.com</a>. Naturally, when building Rentobo, we decided to make it as convenient as possible to post your listing there. But craigslist is only the beginning. Market analysts have determined that 70% or more of new renters begin their searches <a href="http://www.mynewplace.com/press-releases/magnetic-marketing-apartment-owners-can-snare-the-lions-share-of-renters-by-ramping-up-their-online-initiatives">online</a>. With that in mind, we built our promotions tool to capture as much of that market, as efficiently as possible.</p>

<h3>How it works</h3>

<p>The days of needing to be computer savvy to market your property are over. With Rentobo, even a novice can now market online by <a href="http://www.rentobo.com/howitworks">using it to promote their listings</a>.</p>

<p>Using Rentobo, you can promote to craigslist and a host of other major rental search sites simultaneously and with just a few clicks. Unlike posting directly to craigslist, you can upload as many photos as you’d like. Once you have created a listing, Rentobo will automatically save it into your management dashboard in case you need to use it at a later date.</p>

<h3>Accepting applications</h3>

<p>When you create and post a listing with Rentobo, prospective tenants can submit applications online. This way, you can receive information such as employment history, salary information and rental history before you ever speak with them on the phone or see them in person. A lot of landlords and brokers enjoy having this information before moving forward with a full credit and background screening.</p>

<p>*We are also in the process of integrating full background and credit screening with Rentobo. If you would like to learn more and participate in our upcoming, limited beta program for this feature, click <a href="http://www.rentobo.com/tenant_screening">here</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Many landlords and property managers struggle to find ways to keep pace with the growing overhead costs of their rental properties such as increased utility bills, rising insurance premiums and the never-ending demands for maintenance. Here are 4 ways you can increase the revenue from your rental property:</p>

<h3>Complete Simple Renovations</h3>

<p>Tenants like rental units that look updated. By completing simple, low-cost renovations and improvements like painting the walls, updating the light fixtures and replacing the toilet, faucets and electrical switch plates you can breathe new life into a dated rental unit and help attract and retain tenants, reducing your turnover costs. However, try to stay away from low quality updates to your property. Tenants will notice this lack of quality as they continue to inhabit your unit, and they will be less likely to renew.</p>

<h3>Perform Major Upgrades</h3>

<p>If you want to attract premium tenants to your properties, you need to provide them with premium features. Include things like an in-suite washer/dryer, a dishwasher, off-street parking, storage and/or a security system. Consider investing in some capital improvements to your property to make your unit look and feel like a luxury rental. In return, you can charge premium rent for your snazzy, upgraded unit.</p>

<p><strong>See Also</strong> <a href="http://www.rentobo.com/blog/affordable-tips-for-sprucing-up-your-rental/">Affordable Tips for Sprucing Up Your Rental</a></p>

<h3>Raise The Rent</h3>

<p>It sounds easy, but you should verify your units&#8217; rents are priced reasonably according to the local market and neighborhood.
In most jurisdictions, regular rent increases are permitted. If you aren&#8217;t bothering to increase your rent in line with regulations, you&#8217;re leaving money on the table as inflation of maintenance services, regular upkeep and overhead expenses eat away from your bottom line.
Perhaps more importantly, pay attention to similar units in your market.
If your rent is noticeably lower, you probably will want to raise it.
While rent increases tend to be unpopular with tenants, most expect their property owners to charge current market value for their properties.</p>

<h3>Improve Customer Service</h3>

<p>Happy tenants are stable tenants. Think of your tenants as your customers, like any customer-service based business, the better you are at providing great customer service, the more successful your business will be. By responding quickly to <a href="http://www.rentobo.com/blog/responding-quickly-to-maintenance-requests/">maintenance requests</a>, being courteous and presenting yourself in a professional manner (even when you get the dreaded 3 a.m. phone call) your tenants will respond by treating you with respect. They will be more likely to pay their rent on time, take care of their unit and stay put, all things that help to boost your bottom line.</p>

<p>While increasing your rental income can seem like a daunting task, with a little effort and fine-tuning, you can raise the revenues of your rental or property management business.</p>
