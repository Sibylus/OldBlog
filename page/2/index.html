  <div class="entry-content"><p>So you have taken the plunge, and become a new landlord! Maybe you decided to rent out a spare bedroom in your house, or you have acquired your first rental property. Being a landlord is no cakewalk, so hopefully you’ve done your research before taking the plunge. Just in case, here are some checklist items to make sure your business gets started on the right foot.</p>

<h3>Join A Landlord Association</h3>

<p>Many new landlords are in business for themselves&#8212;by themselves. If this is you, joining an association <a href="http://www.rentobo.com/blog/renting-property-join-a-landlord-association/">can have many benefits</a>. You can stay up to date on the local and national laws, news, and the best practices in your market. You can get invaluable insights from more veteran property owners. You can get the scoop on which vendors to use, and which ones to avoid. For example, there are a lot of different associations throughout Chicagoland and the state of Illinois, and a listing of these organizations can be found <a href="http://www.thelpa.com/lpa/associations/illinois.html">here</a>.</p>

<h3>Decide How Much You’re Willing To DIY</h3>

<p>Being a landlord can be a very hands on or automated business depending on how you manage it. Many property owners will go so far as handling maintenance requests by themselves! However, if you aren’t a professional handyman, you need to figure out how you’re going to quickly and efficiently handle repairs. We talk about the <a href="http://www.rentobo.com/blog/responding-quickly-to-maintenance-requests/">importance of handling requests well</a>, and with the right system in place, you will have happier renters and a more profitable business.</p>

<h3>Realize That You Might Get A Bad Renter</h3>

<p>Even the best property owners and managers will have a few renters that are less than ideal. The most common violation that you will face will be late or unpaid rent. Most renters have good intentions when they enter into a lease agreement, but financial situations change, and not everyone is <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2011/05/24/news/economy/americans_lack_emergency_funds/index.htm">prepared for them</a>. We would also recommend you come up with a set policy for noise disturbances and property costs beyond normal wear and tear on your unit.</p>

<h3>Use Rentobo To Find Your First Renters</h3>

<p>Rentobo is a great resource for finding your next renter, whether you are an industry novice or pro. Our simple to use tool will allow you to create a listing and promote your property to craigslist and other major rental search sites simultaneously. Once prospects decide that they are interested, <a href="http://www.rentobo.com">Rentobo</a> allows you to accept applications from them online. Our screening feature (currently in beta) enables you to receive full credit reports complete with scores and criminal background history.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There are a lot of DIY landlords out there. Some property owners got into the business as a way to generate some extra cushion on their monthly expenses; others wanted to replace their job. Many times, a sole proprietor wants to run their business in peace, without brokers or outside property management firms getting in the way. No matter what the circumstances of your business as a landlord; it is always good to join a good landlord association in your area. Here are a few reasons why you should.</p>

<h3>Stay Up To Date On Laws and Restrictions</h3>

<p>Many conflicts between landlords and their tenants occurred not as a result of neglect, but of misinformation. As a landlord, misinformation can mean disaster for your business. However, even if you actively educate yourself, certain new rules and regulations in your market can slip through the cracks. A great way to avoid this dilemma is to join an association.</p>

<p>The benefit here is obvious. You have a community of people as opposed to one, all with the same purpose of adhering to the laws and restrictions of their markets. Many sources are better than one when it comes to protecting your business by being knowledgeable.</p>

<p><strong>Related: <a href="http://www.rentobo.com/blog/importance-of-up-to-date-leases/">The Importance of Up-To-Date Leases and Agreements</a></strong></p>

<h3>Learn About New Trends</h3>

<p>The rental industry is always changing. How people find and sign apartments and leases is different from how how did it 20 years ago, and being part of an association will help you keep tabs on what’s going on.</p>

<p>In addition to knowing your laws, it can be beneficial to follow known best practices in your market. For instance, if you charge $80 per applicant, but the typical application runs closer to $40 in your area, it is better to have this information rather than alienate yourself from additional prospects.</p>

<h3>Networking</h3>

<p>A great way to connect with people that can actually help your business is by being a part of a community with the same agenda as you. In a landlord association, the ‘salesmen’ are going to be limited, so as a landlord, you can network freely and without limitation. Some of the best partnerships occur when people that had no intention of working with someone else suddenly put their heads together.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="right" src="http://oblog.rentobo.com/images/image01.png" width="315" height="185">
Do you dread opening your mailbox? Does that stack of bills pile up every month until it becomes an unmanageable heap? An apartment comes with a multitude of different expenses. Besides paying your rent each month, you most likely have to pay your utility bills, which include gas, electric, heat, cable, internet and any other expenses you are responsible for in your building.</p>

<p>Every month I have to keep up-to-date on my utility bills as well as my credit card bill, tuition payment, and rent. Keeping everything in order and paid on time took awhile to get a handle on. Let’s just say I had to pay a few late fees! Here are some tips on how to manage these monthly bills and make it to the end of the month without any extra fees.</p>

<h3>1. Stay Organized</h3>

<p>My problem is keeping everything organized. With so many bills to pay each month, the biggest challenge I face is just keeping everything in order. Once I started organizing all of my bills and keeping track of what I owed, my life became infinitely easier and my checking account a little heavier. My biggest piece of advice would be to stay organized and always know what you owe.</p>

<h3>2. Process Your Mail Right Away</h3>

<p>I used to let my mail sit for days (and to be truthful, weeks) when I brought it in from the mailbox. One time my mail piled so high that I accidentally threw my electric bill away with a bunch of old take-out menus and forgot to pay it that month. Now I go through my mail daily and separate the bills from the junk mail.</p>

<h3>3. Keep Your Bills in a Designated Place</h3>

<p>It’s easier to stay organized when everything is in one place. I keep mine in the top drawer of my desk and at the end of the month when the bills need to be paid I put them in a basket by the front door so I never forget them on my way out in the morning.</p>

<h3>4. Designate a Specific Time to Pay Your Bills</h3>

<p>Procrastination never helped me in school and it certainly hasn’t helped when it comes to paying bills. I’ve learned that if I set time aside each month, I’m less stressed out. I usually set time aside on the weekend when I have less going on to pay my bills and review my bank balance.</p>

<h3>5. Pay Your Bills Online</h3>

<p>Almost every utility company and bank offers you the ability to pay your bills online. Paying online is more convenient and saves you the trip of having to walk to the mailbox. If you’re a tenant, go one step further and see if your <a href="http://www.williampaid.com/collect-rent-online">landlord</a> will let you <a href="http://www.williampaid.com/pay-rent-online">pay your rent online</a>. It’s one less bill you will have to worry about keeping track of at the end the of the month. As a landlord, Rentobo is in the process of creating a way for you to accept payments online. You can stay up to date by <a href="http://www.rentobo.com">joining our mailing list</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>No tenant should have to wonder whether or not they live in a safe building. However, there are countless stories which prove that not all rental property is safe. A common issue is that many <a href="http://the-accidental-landlord.com/">“accidental landlords”</a> aren’t educated on what makes a building up to code, which can lead to problems down the road. Also, municipalities across the country are having <a href="http://realestate.msn.com/article.aspx?cp-documentid=20171382">trouble keeping up</a> with routine health, safety and fire inspections which only adds to the problem. You should check your local jurisdiction for the most up-to-date laws, but safety should never be an option, so here are some ways to get started.</p>

<h3>Check for obvious fire hazards</h3>

<p>The most common household disaster is <a href="http://www.redcross.org/news/article/Home-Fires-Biggest-Disaster-Threat-in-US">due to fire</a>. Again, check your local jurisdiction, but some common issues to look for include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Lack of a sufficient fire extinguisher</li>
<li>Bad or faulty electric wiring</li>
<li>Lack of a working smoke detector</li>
<li>Objects that obstuct or block emergency exits</li>
</ul>


<p>Fire prevention is often the job of both the tenant and the landlord. The best way to ensure people are being safe is to educate them. To do this, provide your new/current tenants with a simple pamphlet from your local fire department on how to stay safe.</p>

<h3>Have a professional take a look</h3>

<p>Very few property owners or managers are properly qualified to inspect a property. Rather than banking on a routine inspection, be proactive&#8212;<em>especially</em> if your tenants start to complain. To the untrained, it can be difficult to tell if a crack on the side of the building is cosmetic or dangerous. Also, a good inspector can give you a timeline for when something may need to be updated or replaced, so you can plan ahead. Many disasters and lawsuits can be avoided if you don’t neglect the safety of your property by spending the extra money for a proper inspection.</p>

<h3>Make sure renovations are completed by a professional</h3>

<p>The reasons for this should be obvious. If you’ve ever watched the show <a href="http://www.hgtv.com/holmes-inspection/show/index.html">Holmes Inspection</a>, you will have gotten a glimpse of the pitfalls of a bad home installation or inspection. Rather than potentially throwing your money down the drain, make sure that the vendor you choose is proven and trustworthy. Don’t know where to start? <a href="http://www.angieslist.com">Angie’s List</a>, a vendor review service, and <a href="http://www.buildzoom.com">BuildZoom</a>, a locator service for general contractors, are great resources for finding the right company to get the job done.</p>
