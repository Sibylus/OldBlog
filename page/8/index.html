  <div class="entry-content"><p>Managing rental properties can be like running any other business. There are ups and downs in the market, and sometimes a landlord is forced to make adjustments. Life is easy when you have an abundance of eager prospects, but what do you do when interest dries up? Here are some simple fixes that can get your vacancy filled.</p>

<h3>Always assess what you should be charging</h3>

<p>One thing to remember is that a unit is only as valuable as someone is willing to pay for it. While you might not want your rental unit to be a steal-of-a-deal, you don’t want to price yourself out of the competition. If you have trouble finding a tenant, reassess the prices of similar property in your area. Be prepared to lower your rent if the data is convincing enough. If you stay competitive, people will notice.</p>

<h3>Encourage lease renewals</h3>

<p>Keeping your tenants happy increases the likelihood they will renew their lease, sparing you the time and cost associated with finding new tenants. The costs associated with turning over a rental property can be significant (lost rent, marketing/broker’s fees, maintenance, etc.) and <a href="http://www.naahq.org/blog/lists/Posts/Post.aspx?ID=222">can possibly exceed $4,000</a> according to an analysis by the National Apartment Association. Timely responses to maintenance requests and convenient perks like online rental payments are ways to improve tenant satisfaction and your bottom line.</p>

<h3>Consider an inexpensive update</h3>

<p>If your rent is competitive, eventually people will view it. Pay attention to what they say. If the kitchen cabinets are in rough shape, get them fixed. If the carpet is truly repulsive, sometimes a steamvac and shampoo isn’t enough. Change it out. In a situation where your prospects have a choice, they will be looking for a place they can call home, not just rent that is easy on the wallet.</p>

<h3>Offer incentives for referrals</h3>

<p>Sometimes the best way to keep your vacancies filled is to have your current tenants fill vacancies for you. Prospects tend to trust people that they know, so incentivize your renters for finding your next tenant. To do this, ask your tenants if they know someone that may be interested, and that you would be willing to provide a finder’s fee for helping you out. This may amount to a discount on their final month’s rent, or a gift card. If you have a positive relationship with your tenant, they are likely to give you a good referral.</p>

<h3>Pay for utilities</h3>

<p>Sometimes it might be an insignificant cost that keeps your prospects from renting your property. Often a prospective tenant will enjoy not having to pay for utilities like electric or gas. If the amount is too unreasonable, consider paying for a predetermined amount of time, say six months or a year. This will ensure that you keep your expenses at bay in the case of a long term tenant.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>One of the most important things in running a business successfully is to stick to a code of ethics.
Being a landlord is no different. Even if you have had bad experiences in the past,
making ethical decisions is not an option.  In the long run, sticking to a code
of ethics will help you to earn the trust of your tenants and allow you to run
your rental business more smoothly. Here are some ways in which you can make
sure you’re complying with both the law and proper landlord ethics.</p>

<h3>Properly screen applicants by judging them with the exact same standards.</h3>

<p>You might be tempted to ‘trust your instincts’ while screening a tenant. This is
a no-no for ethical AND legal reasons. Whether you are a new landlord or you
have been in business for 30+ years, rejecting a tenant because of appearance,
familial status or employment is against the law. Always be up-to-date and
comply with Fair Housing and Discrimination Laws. Use full credit, background
and reference checks to select your tenants without bias.</p>

<h3>Don’t get carried away with fees and charges.</h3>

<p>Sure, owning and managing a rental property can get expensive, but the tenant
shouldn’t be the only one incurring those costs. It is the landlord’s duty and
responsibility to maintain the rental property. Any increases in rent, deposits
and amenity fees should be reasonable and competitive with the properties in
your area. In today’s market, it is easy to spot a landlord that just wants to
make a quick buck. A rental property with better prices will retain more tenants
for longer periods of time. This will more than likely mean more income for you
in the long-term.</p>

<h3>Make sure you stick to building and habitability codes.</h3>

<p>You can protect yourself and more importantly, your tenants by being
knowledgeable about and sticking to building and habitability codes. This is
especially necessary when conducting maintenance fixes. Building standards, like
electrical wiring and plumbing, tend to get updated over time. Make sure you
know about these changes and hire licensed professionals to make the proper
updates. Some landlords may be tempted to spend less on a quick-fix, but if the
building isn’t kept to standard, tenants aren’t safe and you could get into
legal trouble. Also, it’s unethical.</p>

      <p class="meta">
        








  


<time datetime="2012-10-11T00:00:00-07:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Oct 11<span>th</span>, 2012</time>
        
      </p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As the rental market thrives in the long aftermath of the housing crisis, it can
be tough to shine in a competitive environment. Most of the time, just sticking
to some solid general principles can make the real difference in your listings,
and get the prospective tenants you want to respond to it.</p>

<p>Keeping that in mind, we have put together 5 critical steps you can implement
quickly to maximize the success of your search for tenants.</p>

<h3>A Picture is Worth A Thousand Words</h3>

<p>When it comes to photographs, you need to focus on 2 things&#8212;clarity and
volume. People are visual. Your photographs can say things about an apartment
that descriptive details simply cannot. Generally, the first thing people do
when they view your listing is notice the photographs. Be sure to provide
photographs that will enable your prospects to make informed decisions when
considering your unit for the new home. </p>

<p>The benefit to this is efficiency. If prospective tenants have a clearer vision
of your property, it is likely they will be more serious about choosing it.
Therefore, you are saving time for yourself and your prospective tenants by
showing the unit to someone that is truly interested in living there.</p>

<h3>Every Property Is Unique</h3>

<p><img class="right" src="http://oblog.rentobo.com/images/45060625-stand-out-from-the-crowd1.jpg"></p>

<p>Alongside photographs, fully describing your unit in the listing assists the
prospective tenant in making their decision to view the property. This seems
like a very simple concept, but what we&#8217;ve found is that many listings stick to
the same limited format such as beds/baths, whether it&#8217;s been renovated and not
much else. </p>

<p>Of course, listing core features is important, but this doesn&#8217;t make your
listing all that unique. To stand out, a mere mention of one or two additional
character traits about your property can make a prospective tenant more excited.
Claw-foot tubs? Don&#8217;t leave it out. Old kitchen, newer appliances? Check.
Interesting layout? You get the point.</p>

<p>Remember, an excited prospect will turn in their paperwork more quickly, which
will enable you to rent your unit faster. Listing a few extra details that
distinguish your property will give it a personality that puts your listing
above others. Your prospective tenants will be more likely to want your unique
unit and want to call it home.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Hello all! Again, The Team at Rentobo is constantly looking to improve our site whenever and wherever possible. Some additions/enhancements in this update include:</p>

<h3>Fair And Equal Housing</h3>

<p><img class="right" src="http://oblog.rentobo.com/images/42304096-RentObo_Fair_housing002.png"></p>

<p><a href="http://www.rentobo.com" title="Rentobo.com">Rentobo.com</a> now has various fair and equal housing logos and disclaimers
throughout the site. We feel this is a necessary step in our continued
commitment to ensuring a smooth and efficient user experience for our growing
community of landlords, brokers and rental tenants.</p>

<h3>Site Security</h3>

<p>We now use SSL encryption in areas where sensitive data is collected. This is a
preliminary measure to protect our users against attack and other malicious
activity.</p>

<h3>Navigation</h3>

<p>We have reworked our listing wizard a bit to make navigating your way through a
listing easier. Rentobo is meant to be easy and efficient for pros and
first-timers alike, so we have relied on very helpful feedback to make this
change.</p>

<p>Stay tuned for more updates!
