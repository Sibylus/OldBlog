  <div class="entry-content"><p>Selling your home is an important decision that should be evaluated carefully in the context of your personal and familial financial situation and needs.  While there are many factors as to why someone would sell, the current robust rental climate can spell opportunity for the right potential landlord. Here are some reasons why renting your home&#8212;even temporarily&#8212;could be the right move.</p>

<h3>Cover costs while the housing market rebounds</h3>

<p>If you need to sell your home but you aren’t getting the price you want, you might want to wait a year or two. Having a quality tenant in the meantime can help you bridge the gap. To do this, first calculate the costs of keeping and maintaining your home while it is vacant. There can be some additional costs associated with being a landlord (taxes, general maintenance repairs, etc.) so be sure to include those expenses as well. Next, get a sense of what the going rate is for similar rentals in your area&#8212;you might be surprised by the results. If the difference in costs are justifiable, go for it!</p>

<h3>You can take advantage of both markets</h3>

<p>According to a <a href="http://http://trends.truliablog.com/vis/rentvsbuy-spr2012/">2012 report based on Trulia’s Buy vs. Rent index</a>, it is cheaper to buy than rent in 98 of the 100 largest metro areas in the country. Chances are that you live in an area where you can take advantage of this. Here’s how: maximize the monthly cash flow coming into your household by securing a tenant at a monthly rate that would surpass your current mortgage. Whether you are downsizing, upgrading or making a parallel switch to a different area, your monthly mortgage cost will likely be less than the monthly rent amount for a similar property. In other words, <em>you are getting the best for your money at both ends of the spectrum</em>.</p>

<h3>You can avoid foreclosure</h3>

<p>The sad truth is that a good amount of families will list their home in order to avoid foreclosure. What’s worse is that a portion of these same families are underwater in their mortgages. However, for some of these people, and maybe you, having a tenant might save you from foreclosure. While it can be difficult to downsize by <em>buying</em> another house (especially with an underwater mortgage,) you can scout for a lease of your own and slash your monthly housing payment. Meanwhile, you can lease your home to a tenant that can pay a premium that will cover most, if not all, your mortgage payment. This is a savvy method of keeping a house that you may not currently be able to afford, and many real estate brokers will recommend this exact move.</p>

<p>As always, there are many factors to consider before becoming a landlord. Before making any decision like this, it is important to fully understand the implications (taxes, lifestyle, and time) of each option. If you do choose to make the leap &#8211; keep <a href="http://www.rentobo.com">Rentobo</a> bookmarked as the easiest way to find your tenant and manage your new rental property.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Even the best landlord can fall victim to a scam. However, you can avoid being a victim of one if you know what to look for. Here are some simple rules you can follow to sniff out a fraud before they can do damage to your business.</p>

<h3>Meet with the prospective tenant whenever possible</h3>

<p>Meeting in person can protect both the landlord and the potential tenant during the leasing process. A genuine prospect shouldn’t have any trouble agreeing to meet. Sometimes you will have an out-of-state or even an international prospect (<a href="http://www.rentobo.com/blog/three-tips-for-brokering-a-relocating-tenant">see our article on leasing to out-of-state or relocating tenants</a>). This is OK, but make sure you communicate directly with the renter and recognize when they are trying to withhold certain details about their identity. Any refusal to provide you with reasonable information (employment info, ssn on the application, past rental history, etc.) is suspicious and you should probably move on.</p>

<h3>Do not accept cashier&#8217;s checks or wire transfers</h3>

<p>Some scammers might try to avoid meeting with you in person and will dodge the verification process. One way for them to do this is to <em>advance</em> a deposit in the form of cashier’s checks or wire transfers, which are hard to trace. A person with a bad rental history may try to con their way into your unit by paying you money upfront, under a different name. Avoid this by refusing payment via these methods and opt for a check instead.</p>

<h3>Check periodically for copycat listings</h3>

<p>What some scammers will do is pose as the landlord of your property, even if its not currently available, and offer the same unit at a too good to be true price. They will then collect deposit money from prospective tenants and disappear overnight. The tenant is left with no money and no apartment. Others will go so far as to collect rent from a <a href="http://www.independentmail.com/news/2013/feb/15/deputies-fake-landlord-rented-homes-he-didnt-own/">property they didn&#8217;t own</a>. To avoid this, simply check for listings with your address or zip code on Google or rental search sites such as craigslist. If you don’t see your name or an authorized contact as the listed agent, report the listing immediately.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Not all prospects are local. Everyday, people across the country and abroad search for and sign a lease on a new apartment. Many times the lease is signed before the tenant has had a chance to view the unit. Some people have concerns with this process, also known as “blind leasing,” so here are some tips on how to avoid the pitfalls and make the transition easy for yourself and your prospective tenant.</p>

<h3>Clarity is crucial in your listing</h3>

<p>If you want your listing to appeal to as many buyers as possible, you need to include some critical details. This means going beyond the usual language of bed/bath and whether the countertops are granite. While this information is important for everyone, relocating prospects are more concerned with information about the neighborhood, school district and proximity to points of interest. After all, the actual unit is only part of the overall living experience for your tenant, and a well-informed prospect will be happier with their decision.</p>

<h3>Good pictures of actual unit</h3>

<p>Many listings, particularly ones in larger buildings, will contain pictures of a unit ‘similar’ to the actual one. If someone reaches out to you about your listing, take the extra step to send them more accurate pictures. These images can be a substitute when the tenant can’t actually visit the unit. Make sure the images are clear and include descriptions. If you do this right, a prospective tenant can have a clear visual of the place they may move into, which will make their decision easier.</p>

<h3>Communicate well</h3>

<p>The importance of communication is magnified when your prospect can’t meet with you in person. So make sure that you keep you communicate well with your prospects, whether it’s via email, phone or both. The average out-of-state tenant is going to have more questions during the process, so it’s good practice to ensure that you are easy to reach. Again, this is good customer service, which can go a long way in such a competitive market.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The digital age has made various aspects of the property rental industry easier for businesses to maintain their day-to-day job. This includes the rental application. Online rental applications help streamline the application portion of the rental process and provide various benefits that paper versions cannot.</p>

<h3>Time Saver</h3>

<p>The amount of time you save by switching to online rental applications is the number one reason why property managers choose this option. Online applications allow the potential resident to quickly find out if they are eligible as a renter. After the credit and background checks come back, you can approve the resident and allow them to log in to the website and sign the apartment lease in a matter of minutes. Since electronic signatures are now considered as legally binding as written ones, the tenant can easily sign all required documents from the comfort of their home.</p>

<h3>Ease of Use</h3>

<p>Internet usage is more popular now than ever, and potential renters regularly search online for available rental properties. Online rental applications allow potential renters to fill out and send in the application as soon as they find your listing online. Offering the convenience of online rental applications puts you ahead of the competition and increases the amount of applications you receive. In addition, your listing will reach a greater number of tech-savvy, young tenants who know you are the type of landlord they can easily work with.</p>

<h3>Better Organization and Less Clutter</h3>

<p>Electronic applications drastically reduce the amount of paper flow you have to deal with. Rather than wading through a filing cabinet packed with individual leases, instantly pull the desired lease up on your computer. Also, you can easily make changes to your lease and make it available to residents immediately.</p>

<h3>Getting Started</h3>

<p>Getting started with online rental applications is a relatively simple process with various online resources designed to help property owners new to electronic applications. Typically, you can choose from a wide array of pre-made templates for the application or customize your very own. Another option is to upload the current application you are using and make it available electronically for potential renters.</p>

<p>Computers, the Internet and technology in general have greatly simplified and improved the way potential tenants find properties. By implementing electronic applications, you ensure your business won&#8217;t miss out on all the benefits provided by online applications.</p>
