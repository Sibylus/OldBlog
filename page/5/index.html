  <div class="entry-content"><p>In most cities, both local and state jurisdictions regulate important property management issues such as collecting and returning security deposits, rental rate increases and the terms of the tenancy. Landlords need to maintain current leases and rental agreements for all their units in order to qualify for protection under landlord-tenant laws as well as to protect them against any hassles that can arise during the tenancy.</p>

<h3>The Basics of Rental Leases and Agreements</h3>

<p>Property management can be a complex business - landlords need to deal with both financial issues (collecting rent) and human rights issues (such as anti-discrimination laws). While many successful, long-term landlord-tenant relationships are based on nothing more than a simple handshake, unless there is a compelling reason to skip the paperwork it&#8217;s always wise to get the rental terms in writing.</p>

<h3>What Can Go Wrong</h3>

<p>In the absence of a current rental agreement or an up-to-date lease, tenant complications or opportunistic scammers can wreak havoc on your property management business. Most tenants are decent, honest people, but you should take steps to protect yourself from professional scammers. There are some <a href="http://www.massrealestatelawblog.com/2012/02/19/massachusetts-landlords-be-aware-of-the-professional-tenant/">“professional tenants”</a> who are skilled at gaming the system by manipulating the rental laws to their advantage, causing their property owners and managers a great deal of grief and monetary loss.</p>

<p>For example, if you don&#8217;t have a current, written lease, how can you prove the terms of the tenancy should you wind up in a legal battle? Unsavory tenants have been known to make wild claims against unsuspecting landlords in order to skip out on their rent, avoid paying for damages, or worse yet, to make a financial claim for damages against their landlord. A current rental agreement protects landlords and tenants by ensuring that all the terms of the tenancy are in writing. Everything related to the tenancy (particularly the financial details) should be covered in a lease or separate rider/addendum, such as the pet policy, amount and due date of rent and details about the security deposit and future rent increases.</p>

<p>By keeping up-to-date rental agreements and leases on file for all your rental properties, you can set expectations with your tenants, protect yourself and your business in the event that something goes wrong, and reduce your chances of falling victim to scams.</p>

<time datetime="2013-03-22T00:00:00-07:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Mar 22<span>nd</span>, 2013</time>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>One of the biggest dilemmas that every property owner may face is the question of whether or not to rent to their friends. On one hand, the idea of renting out a unit to a friend is very attractive; after all, these aren&#8217;t just people who you happen to know, they&#8217;re actually people who you like and trust. On the other hand, many people swear by the old adage that you shouldn&#8217;t mix business with pleasure, and many great friendships have been ruined when money muddies the waters.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re thinking of renting to your friends, here are three things you should consider:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Why are you thinking of renting to friends? Perhaps you&#8217;re having a tough time finding good tenants for your unit and you see your friends as nice, responsible people who will make great tenants. Or perhaps you feel like you need to help your nomadic buddy out; after all, the poor guy can&#8217;t seem to catch a break when it comes to landlords - that&#8217;s why he&#8217;s moved 5 times in the last few years (right)?</p></li>
<li><p>Can you wear both hats - friend and landlord? Renting to your friends means that you&#8217;ll need to collect rent from them, fix their toilet and confront them on any damage or disruptive behavior - are you up for that?</p></li>
<li><p>Could you evict your friend? The unfortunate reality of the rental business is that sometimes things get ugly and property owners need to be the bad guy/gal and serve an eviction notice to a tenant. If that tenant happens to be a friend, could you do it?</p></li>
</ol>


<p>If you do opt to cross the friend-tenant boundary and rent to a friend, it&#8217;s important to maintain the same tenant screening standards that you would with anybody. Don&#8217;t give in to the urge to skip a credit check and forego references based on your friendship. Remember that no matter who you rent your unit to, your livelihood depends on your tenants paying their rent (in full and on time), maintaining the property in good order and behaving in a way that is respectful to both the other tenants in the building and the surrounding neighbors. Lay out these expectations up front and maintain them with your tenant/friend; this will help to both preserve your friendship and your business.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>While property owners in high demand areas have less difficulty recruiting tenants, investors who own rental units in areas with high vacancy rates may need to offer rental concessions to both current and prospective tenants. If your rental property is located in an area where there are more vacancies than there are qualified tenants, providing perks to your renters can make the difference between maintaining your rental cash flow or having your units sit empty.</p>

<h3>What Concessions Should You Offer?</h3>

<p>A Los Angeles landlord recently made headlines with her unique rental concession; Sandy Zalegens, a property investor and animal rescue advocate, recently offered new tenants a $150 discount on their monthly $950 rent on the condition that they adopt Big Louie, a 80-pound Pit Bull dog who <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/17/pitbulls-landlord-discounts-rent_n_1790737.html">needed a home.</a></p>

<p><strong>See Also:</strong> <a href="http://www.rentobo.com/blog/ethical-challenges-of-being-a-landlord/">Ethical Challenges of Being a Landlord</a></p>

<p>Although Zalegens&#8217; concession did help her find a great tenant for her unit, most property owners cannot (and likely should not) be quite that creative when it comes to providing incentives to attract tenants. Nevertheless, it might not hurt to think ‘outside of the box’ when it comes to offering concessions. Consider what you can offer, focusing first on low-cost ideas such as allowing pets, providing free parking or including cable TV service. Enticing tenants by including utilities is another popular perk, as it saves them the hassle of activating their own utility accounts while the cost to the landlord is usually justified.</p>

<h3>Concessions Can Help Improve Retention Rates</h3>

<p>Rental concessions aren&#8217;t just for new tenants &#8212; by offering &#8220;loyalty rewards&#8221; to stable tenants, you will cut your vacancy rates as well as eliminate the costs associated with tenant turnover. Ongoing retention incentives can include deals like &#8220;pay 12 months, get the 13th month rent-free,&#8221; and discounted rates on laundry tokens and cards (if you offer a tenant laundry room). You can also research bulk discounts on sports tickets, fitness center passes and grocery gift cards to give as &#8220;thank you&#8221; gifts to stable tenants.</p>

<p>The type of concessions you offer will depend on the demands of both your market and your tenants. The bottom line is that it is better to offer rental concessions for continued cash-flow than to have your rental properties remain vacant.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The rental business is tough &#8211; even profitable landlords or property management firms can benefit from a closer inspection of rental marketing strategies, communication practices and rental listing advertising costs. Many owners or managers use inefficient processes to get the job done. Here are some tips to help you increase your bottom line from the inside out.</p>

<h3>Promote correctly</h3>

<p>There are two things to consider when optimizing your marketing efforts. You should keep your costs low (free if possible) and automate as much as you can. If you are using <a href="http://www.rentobo.com">Rentobo</a>, you can use our <a href="http://www.rentobo.com/benefits#exposure">listing syndication feature</a> to post simultaneously to multiple major rental search sites, including craigslist. This feature is completely free and we have gotten great feedback regarding the ease of use and the level of traffic generated. If you choose to supplement your marketing to other sources, stick with a strategy that will give you a proper return on your investment.</p>

<h3>Communicate properly</h3>

<p>When communicating with your prospects, don’t get too carried away. Use a couple lines of communication, but manage them well. In other words, you don’t need to leave your mobile, office, fax and email address in your listings. It can be difficult to respond quickly to initial inquiries if you have to check too many sources.</p>

<p>Stick to a primary business phone and/or email address that you can access quickly and frequently. Sometimes an excited prospect can become a lost prospect because your response time wasn’t satisfactory. Communicate efficiently, and your prospects will recognize that you are on top of things and will be more likely to rent from you.</p>

<h3>Trim the fat</h3>

<p>More isn’t always better. Many profitable property owners and managers continue to invest in solutions that are unnecessary or do not perform well. There is no reason to generate 50 prospects if only 10 routinely provide high-quality tenants.</p>

<p>Examine each one of your traffic sources. For instance, if you run print ads in the classifieds for your rental units, get a sense of how much traffic those ads are actually generating. A simple way to do this is to ask each one of your prospects where they saw your listing. You can keep track of which sources bring you the most and best leads by asking potential residents to fill out guest cards when they visit your property.</p>

<p>Also, take an inventory of your other expenses and see where you can make changes. Does your landscaping company overcharge for subpar work? Do you spend too much money each time you run a credit screen? Even if you pass on some of these expenses to your tenants, they will appreciate the lower costs of a more efficient process.</p>

<p>Maximizing efficiency is an ongoing process. The best methods available a decade ago may not be the effective methods for your business today. Many times, the difference between optimal and ‘good enough’ lies in your efficiency. With that in mind, make sure you consistently look for ways to improve.</p>
