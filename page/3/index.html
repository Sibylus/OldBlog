  <div class="entry-content"><p>Landlords who want to attract the best tenants and achieve low turnover rates know the importance of regular property maintenance, however, most property owners have difficulty deciding if they should invest in a major renovation on their personal rental property. When renting property, it can be tempting to simply leave your rental units alone, but doing the right renovations can maintain the value of your investment. You can also attract higher rent payments from stable tenants who are willing to pay a premium for a modern, updated rental apartment or home.</p>

<h3>When Rental Property Renovations Make Sense</h3>

<p>Doing renovations on personal rental property makes sense if you are looking to increase the rent payments, if you plan on selling the unit soon or you want to make major changes to attract more tenants. For example, if you consistently have trouble renting out a studio (bachelor) apartment, it might make sense to convert that unit into a one-bedroom to attract tenants who like the idea of having a traditional-style bedroom.</p>

<p>See Also: <a href="http://www.rentobo.com/blog/affordable-tips-for-sprucing-up-your-rental/">The affordable way to renovate when renting property.</a></p>

<h3>Research Before You Renovate</h3>

<p>Before you decide to undertake any renovations, take the time to do some market research; check your area classified ads to see what style of units seem to be in high demand and which ones look difficult to rent out. Often small low-cost renovations, such as adding in-suite laundry, installing a dishwasher or upgrading the bathroom can allow you to command higher rents for your personal rental property.</p>

<p>Another key factor in deciding whether or not personal rental property renovations are worth it is the time it will take you to recover your costs - for example, if you invest $3000 to improve the bathroom, how much will you need to raise the monthly rent to cover that cost (and will the market bear the higher rent)?</p>

<h3>Timing Your Rental Renovations</h3>

<p>The best time to upgrade your personal rental property is when you are between tenants - trying to do major renovations while the unit is occupied is a recipe for disaster. Anything that you or your contractors do that might be perceived as diminishing the habitability of the unit (such as temporary disruptions to the water or electrical service) can put you at risk of legal trouble from your current tenant.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Homeowner’s insurance is required by any mortgagee and will cover the property itself, any outbuildings as well as the contents of the structure. Landlord’s insurance is required as well, and on top of the building and such being covered; the landlord will also be protected against lawsuits that may occur due to an accident on the property. However, what many tenants do not know is that landlord’s insurance does not cover their personal possessions. Unfortunately, when disasters occur, this lack of coverage can be a real shock to tenants. If this piece of information isn’t compelling enough, here are some other reasons why every tenant should obtain renter’s insurance.</p>

<h3>It protects your belongings</h3>

<p>As a tenant the most compelling and obvious reason for you to be insured is that it will protect your belongings. Landlord’s insurance will not. Policies differ as to whether they offer replacement coverage, which would pay the full cost of replacing an item, or whether the check is mailed out based off of current cash value. In other words, that $1,000 TV that you purchased 6-7 years ago at retail may get assessed and paid at a few hundred dollars instead of the full amount, depending on your coverage.</p>

<p>A good renter’s insurance policy will cover a tenant for burglary as well as something more disastrous such as a fire or flood.</p>

<h3>It prevents liability</h3>

<p>Say one of your guests (or a plumber) trips over an extension cord in your unit, and breaks his ankle. If you get sued and you don’t have insurance, the odds are going to be stacked against you. If the guest trips on his way up the stairs, the landlord would potentially be liable. But because things such as furniture, extension cords and electronics are your property, you are legally obligated to cover those losses.</p>

<p>Many renters are under the impression that if someone is injured in their unit, they will be covered by the landlord’s insurance. This could explain why <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Business/survey-shows-renters-insurance/story?id=18685618#.UYlU1bWHv-s">two-thirds of renters</a> do not have insurance. If such a scenario occurs and you have renter’s insurance, the typical policy will cover any court award up to a <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Business/survey-shows-renters-insurance/story?id=18685618#.UYlU1bWHv-s">$100,000 limit.</a></p>

<h3>It’s inexpensive</h3>

<p>Perhaps the most surprising thing about insuring your rental possessions is that it is inexpensive. The average renter’s policy only costs about <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Business/survey-shows-renters-insurance/story?id=18685618#.UYlU1bWHv-s">$185 a year</a>. You can get $50,000 worth of coverage for about <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/29/realestate/getting-started-a-word-to-the-wise-renter-insurance.html?_r=1&amp;">$300 a year</a>. Many policies will include some type of initial deductible should you need to file a claim, and cover any reasonable expenses thereafter. Some companies will also offer a discount should you bundle auto insurance with your policy.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="right" src="http://oblog.rentobo.com/images/wp_lease_image.png" title="Rental Agreement Form" ></p>

<p>When I went to look for my third apartment in the city, I started to learn that not
only is it important to look for a great apartment and location but that finding a
great <a href="http://www.williampaid.com/blog/index.php/2012/07/a-good-landlord-is-not-always-easy-to-find/">landlord</a> is equally as important. While “location, location, location” may be
the universal mantra of real estate agents and renters, my own personal mantra
during my apartment searches has been “landlord, landlord, landord!”
After having three different landlords in the span of three years, I can hopefully shed
some light on what landlords can do to better serve their renters.</p>

<h3>Know the laws of the city you are leasing in</h3>

<p>Each state and city has a landlord and tenant act that covers specific laws and
regulations regarding rent, security deposits, tenant rights, evictions, etc. My first
landlord printed a general Chicago <a href="http://www.williampaid.com/blog/index.php/2012/04/renting-an-apartment-top-10-questions-to-ask-a-landlord-before-signing-a-lease/">lease</a> and when my roommates and I asked
questions about late fees and certain laws that we might have to abide by, she
looked at us with a dumbstruck look of confusion. It was hard for us to take her
seriously when she didn’t even know the basic laws that she as a landlord was
expected to follow. Know the laws and be able to articulate them to your renters.</p>

<h3>Customize the lease</h3>

<p>Having a custom lease with personal instructions you want your renters to follow
is always helpful. My one landlord did this and he had a ‘move-out rider” attached
to the lease that detailed exactly what he wanted us to do when we moved out,
complete with a checklist. This was a great way for us to know exactly what was
expected of us so that our security deposit could be returned in full.</p>

<h3>Listen to our concerns</h3>

<p>One time both the front and back doors of my apartment building were broken and
I promptly called my landlord to let him know that I wanted it fixed. I called on a
Friday and no one came to fix either door until Monday morning. When it comes to
matters of safety, a landlord should respond in a timely manner. This is especially
important if the problem makes the apartment and your renters susceptible to
harm and theft. If it’s something as little as a broken dishwasher or as serious as
a broken front door, make sure you listen to your renter’s concerns and respond
appropriately. And for the safety of us renters, quickly!</p>

<h3>Be attentive (but respect our privacy!)</h3>

<p>Be there when you‘re needed but don’t hover. The landlord in my first apartment
kept some of her old things in our apartment and proceeded to let herself in to grab
things whenever she needed. This is not only illegal but also definitely a violation
of a renter’s privacy. Don’t barge in whenever you please. While we may be renting,
this is our apartment for the duration of the lease. Plus, we could be just getting out
of the shower!</p>

<h3>Offer Online Rent Payments</h3>

<p>Every landlord I’ve had has been very specific about how they want to receive rent.
The easiest way for renters is to pay rent online. For landlords, this will ensure that
rent is received on time each month. It is simple and convenient for renters and
after all, doesn’t a happy renter make a happy landlord?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The average homeowner buys and sells a home <a href="http://homebuying.about.com/od/sellingahouse/qt/0207WhyMove.htm">every 5-7 years</a>, so it is important to examine the costs over that period of time. Across the country, it is now less expensive to <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jed-kolko/renting-vs-buying_b_1881185.html">buy a home versus renting one</a> (which is great for landlords looking to profit on their investment). However, if a 20% down payment, inability to obtain financing, or other reasons make homeownership not in the cards, there are some markets where renting could be far more attractive.</p>

<h3>Methodology</h3>

<p>We took the most recent averages for a market (home sales price and rent price for a 2 bedroom residence) and compiled data based off of the following terms:</p>

<ul>
<li>2 bedroom residence</li>
<li>20% down payment</li>
<li>3.5% mortgage interest</li>
<li>Property tax for the listed market</li>
<li>6 years of tenancy</li>
<li>Other miscellaneous considerations, such as closing costs and maintenance costs (we used <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/business/buy-rent-calculator.html?_r=0">this tool</a> to help with our calculations).</li>
</ul>


<p>In addition to our input of raw data, we considered other more realistic factors, such as the typical “for sale” home being larger and more luxurious than the typical rental. With these factors in mind, we have put together three of the best cities you can live in if you are looking to rent instead of purchasing a home.</p>

<p><strong><em>For Landlords:</em></strong> <a href="http://www.rentobo.com/blog/single-family-rental-investment/">The case for single-family rental investment</a></p>

<h3>Manhattan, NY - (2 bedroom $850,000 sales price vs $3,650/mo rent)</h3>

<p><em>$3,673 savings/year for renters</em></p>

<p>Manhattan is a densely populated island, and is the most expensive of the five boroughs
of New York. In addition to the towering skyscrapers already present there, there is constant new construction. Even so, the vacancy rate is hovering <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-01-10/manhattan-rent-hikes-slow-as-apartment-tenants-push-back.html">around 1.5%</a> due to improving employment in a notoriously high demand area.</p>

<p>A modest 2 bedroom apartment in Manhattan will cost you around $850,000, which is much more comparable to the typical apartment for rent, but if you are looking for something more luxurious, expect your costs on either end to skyrocket (the actual average luxury 2 bedroom apartment was <a href="http://www.citi-habitats.com/media/pdf/Q2Report-2012.pdf">$1.25 million in 2012</a>).</p>

<h3>San Francisco, CA - (2 bedroom $725,000 sales price vs $2,900/mo rent)</h3>

<p><em>$2,081 savings/year for renters</em></p>

<p>The temperate San Francisco climate and high salaries due to the tech industry have driven a large number of workers to a tiny geographical area (less than 47 square miles for over 800,000 people),  so in the last decade San Francisco has become a very expensive place to live. A lot of people looking to live in San Francisco-proper have opted instead to live in nearby San Jose or Oakland, where prices are cheaper but rising.</p>

<p>San Francisco is a market with built-in demand and short supply, due to high population density but a shortage of skyscrapers. In fact, the only major US city with a higher population density in the entire US is New York.</p>

<h3>Honolulu, HI - (2 bedroom $465,000 sales price vs $1,725/mo rent)</h3>

<p><em>$446 savings/year for renters</em></p>

<p>Honolulu, HI is an island &#8211; like Manhattan &#8211; that is as much a destination for tourists as it is a hometown for locals. Many homes purchased here are used for secondary or vacation homes, and that secondary market has added to the demand.</p>
