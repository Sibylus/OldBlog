  <div class="entry-content"><p>Dear Rentobo Users,</p>

<p>Late Monday night (Apr 7), a major website security vulnerability was announced in the open source library OpenSSL. OpenSSL powers SSL encryption (the secure HTTPS you sometimes see in your address bar) on more than two-thirds of all websites on the internet. To read more information about this vulnerability, now known as the “Heartbleed bug,” click <a href="http://gizmodo.com/heartbleed-why-the-internets-gaping-security-hole-is-1560812671">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Rentobo is now secure.</strong> As of Tuesday night (Apr 8), Rentobo and our underlying service providers have performed all necessary updates to ensure secure communication.</p>

<p>What does this mean for Rentobo users?</p>

<p>While there is no evidence that Rentobo specifically has been compromised by the Heartbleed bug, the severe and relatively undetectable nature of this bug encourages us to be very cautious. We strongly recommend that all users change their passwords for Rentobo, as well as any other website where sensitive information is stored.</p>

<p>For our tech-savvy users:</p>

<ul>
<li>As of 6:08pm Pacific, April 8th 2014, Rentobo’s hosting provider Heroku is reporting that all SSL endpoints have been updated to a secure, patched version of OpenSSL.</li>
<li>Rentobo has updated the SSL private keys for all of our servers to protect against the possibility that existing keys were compromised.</li>
<li>The <a href="http://www.heartbleed.com">heartbleed FAQ</a> provides a more in-depth and technical explanation of this incident.</li>
</ul>


<p>Moving forward, we want to assure our users that Rentobo continues to be a tool that landlords and brokers can feel confident using as a safe technology to help navigate the rental process. Security and transparency is our highest priority, and we will keep you informed on any future updates.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Selecting a tenant is the most important decision you will make managing a rental. It’s far easier to deny an unqualified application than to <a href="http://www.rentobo.com/blog/ethical-challenges-of-being-a-landlord/">evict a renter</a>, so it’s important to know what you’re getting into up front. You don’t want to end up with a nightmare tenant! Sound stressful? Don’t worry, Rentobo’s got your back.</p>

<p>The more useful information you have, the more informed a decision you can make. That’s why we are proud to announce that starting today you have the option to automatically search TransUnion’s national database of eviction records when renters apply with Rentobo! Just one more way you’re protected by using our first-rate tool for marketing your listing and screening potential renters.</p>

<p>Here’s how it works:</p>

<p>When creating/editing your listings, you will now have 3 screening options.</p>

<p><img src="http://oblog.rentobo.com/images/screening_options.png"></p>

<p>The most comprehensive screening option includes the applicant supplied profile (employment history, rental history, references, etc&#8230;), a credit report (credit score + detailed history), criminal records, and eviction records. We recommend this option as it will provide you with all available information on the applicant so you can make the best possible application decision. If you select this option, each of your prospects will pay $45 to get their application processed.</p>

<p>If you are not interested in receiving evictions records, you can select our middle option. With this option you will receive the same comprehensive credit history and criminal records check you have come to expect from Rentobo, and your prospects will pay only a $35 application fee.</p>

<p>Like to live dangerously?  You can disable tenant screening altogether and still use Rentobo to receive basic applications to your listing with no cost to your applicants. With this option applications will include only the  information submitted by the applicant themselves. Still, we highly recommend that you run a screening report on each one of your prospects, no matter how great they seem to be. When it comes to tenants, nobody wants surprises.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Marketing a rental listing is about getting exposure, which will draw prospects to your unit. When generating interest for your listing, a lot of property owners will settle for “good enough.” Unfortunately, if you settle for promoting your unit “just on craigslist,” for example, you really limit your audience. Here we present the case for syndicating your listings across multiple search sites.</p>

<h3>It&#8217;s Faster</h3>

<p>Most property owners agree that displaying their listings in more than one place is beneficial. However, manually visiting each website individually to post their listings is hard to manage and time consuming. With multiple listings and properties, the problem is magnified greatly.</p>

<p>So if your time is precious, like all professionals and property owners, you’ve probably wished there was a better way. When you syndicate your listing using a syndication platform, such as <a href="http://www.rentobo.com">Rentobo</a>, you can actually submit your listing to multiple search sites at the same time. This will save you a lot of time and give you more time to work on other areas of your business.</p>

<h3>It’s Efficient</h3>

<p>In the real estate and rental markets, the term <a href="http://www.thefreedictionary.com/Syndication">syndication</a> has taken on a whole new meaning. When you choose to market your listing using a syndication platform such as Rentobo, you choose to let a multitude of real estate rental search sites, such as Zillow, Apartable, and Lovely, promote a common interest by displaying your listings. This is truly a powerful thing when you think about it.</p>

<p>Each one of these sites generate thousands of new eyes a day in most markets. Granted, some of those site visitors of Zillow may have come from craigslist. However, if a rental prospect has viewed your listing on multiple listing sites, they are more likely to click on it. Now, instead of posting on one site over and over again, you are able to provide multiple impressions through one piece of effort. That’s efficient.</p>

<h3>It’s Easy</h3>

<p>At Rentobo, we have made it incredibly easy to syndicate your listings. In just a few seconds, you can submit your listing to the most popular rental search sites on the web, simultaneously. This is how it works:</p>

<p>Once you have created a listing using Rentobo, you can manage your marketing efforts by selecting the<strong> Promote tab.</strong></p>

<p>Simply scroll to the bottom, and you will see a list of syndication partners to choose from. After that, just select the boxes corresponding to the sites you want to submit to, and click ‘Save Syndication Options.’
That’s it! Once your selections have been saved, Rentobo will create and submit listings to the partners you have selected, where they will appear within 24-48 hours.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It’s been an exciting few months for Rentobo. Our team has been hard at work making improvements and implementing new features to bring you the biggest release since we first launched Rentobo.</p>

<p>We’re proud to announce Rentobo’s Automated Tenant Screening - a better way to find the best tenant for your rental properties, along with numerous other improvements to our application process and Rentobo overall.</p>

<h3>Free to Landlords, Managers, and Agents</h3>

<p>As of today, Tenant Credit &amp; Background Screening is available to all Rentobo users at no additional charge.  Simply enable Tenant Screening on your new or existing listing and you will automatically receive complete credit and criminal conviction reports with all applications to your listing.  Renters pay a $35 application fee directly to Rentobo to cover the cost of the report, enabling us to make screening available at no additional cost to you.</p>

<p><strong>Setting up Screening</strong></p>

<p>To receive screening reports for your new or existing listing, select the <strong>“Enable TransUnion tenant screening reports”</strong> checkbox on the new “Credit &amp; Background Screening” page of your listing configuration.  Answer a few questions about your property and prospective tenants (so we can provide customized creditworthiness recommendations), save your changes, and we’ll do the rest.</p>

<p>For more information check out our <a href="http://oblog.rentobo.com/images/Credit_Screening_Getting_Started.pdf">Getting Started Guide</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Reviewing Credit Recommendations and Reports</strong></p>

<p>Once you receive applications to your listing, you can review the credit recommendation and full credit and criminal history details under each application.</p>

<h3>A Better Way to Screen Tenants</h3>

<p>Rentobo has integrated with TransUnion to provide the easiest, most secure way to receive credit and criminal history reports from your applicants. You can be up and running in the time it takes to check a box, with no additional configuration required.</p>

<p>Thanks to TransUnion&#8217;s proprietary technology, Rentobo users can bypass the site inspection, lengthy approval process, and the myriad of other obstacles usually required by most credit data providers. Since we never store your applicants’ social security numbers and have partnered with one of the largest credit reporting agencies in the world, renters can rest easy knowing their information is in safe hands. This process is also better for renters as all Rentobo screening reports are generated using a “soft inquiry,” which means unlike traditional credit inquiries there is no impact to the renters&#8217; credit scores.</p>

<h3>Improved Online Rental Applications</h3>

<p>We’ve also added several new features and streamlined our <a href="http://www.rentobo.com/blog/benefits-of-online-rental-applications/">online rental application</a>. We’ve made it easier for groups of roommates or a prospect and a co-signer to apply with each other. We&#8217;ve improved our landlord notifications and added the ability for landlords to invite renters to apply directly through Rentobo. Finally, on your Rentobo dashboard you’re now presented with an Applications tab where you can view application statuses and details across all of your listings in one place.</p>
